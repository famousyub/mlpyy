","Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films.

21 November 2001,jhclues,10," The Magic Comes To Life!
","Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2017,stormhawk2021,8," Epic film
","Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

","I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Great fun!
","I really liked this film, but I much prefer the book, which has a lot more magic and wonder. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

","Over-hyped but still enjoyable ""event"" movie, one of the biggest of 2001 until LORD OF THE RINGS comes out, and a film in which every million of the budget is put up on screen in the special effects. What I found most refreshing about this blockbuster is that the entire cast is made up of British actors and actresses! It makes a change for an expensive blockbuster movie to be thus but there you go, HARRY POTTER is indeed a unique movie. Now I'm not one of those people with lots of time on their hands to read the never-ending Harry Potter books (too busy watching cult movies I'm afraid), but the film has turned out pretty much as I would have expected from the adverts. Although it's overly sentimental (blame it on director Chris Columbus) and aimed at children, adults can still enjoy it for the excellent pacing (rarely does the two-and-a-half hour running time drag) and the plethora of special - and some not so special - effects on view throughout.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2014,ironhorse_iv,7," This movie set in stone, what would be the foundation of the Harry Potter film franchise. It kinda work.
","It's seem like just yesterday, when the movie about the boy whom lived, was about to come out. People were wondering if the Harry Potter's books by J.K Rowling could easily be translated into the big screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone AKA Sorcerer's Stone directed by Chris Columbus, indeed show that it was somewhat possible. The story follows Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)'s first year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry as he discovers his gift and destiny against the dark forces of magic. The movie like the other films are cut into two plots directions. One is about student life at Hogwarts during the school-year, while the other half is about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. It works well as a long read novel, but in movie form: its means a long sit through. The movie pacing is so long. It takes forever to get to the main plot of Harry Potter finding the Philosopher Stone. There are is a lot of filler scenes that could be cut away. I dislike how the Philosopher Stone is one-time movie McGuffin. For the best of my knowledge, the Philosopher stone plays no factor after this movie, and never mention again after this film. The third act, mostly comes out of nowhere. The twist toward the end, was pretty predictable, if you readt the books, but pretty interesting. Another thing about the movie is how non-logical the movie is. It really baffled me, how much exposition, it needed. Even an hour in the film, there were a lot of random odd things happening without much explaining. It gets more confusing as long bits of the book, like the Centaur showing in the woods, were shorten in the film. It gets worst for the centaur, as he wouldn't play a factor, in any of the later films, despite, saving Harry Potter from Voldermort. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also cut short. Her riddle solving in the book was cut from the film. Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, as well. Despite those, the movie is really close to the novel. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. Still, there were some really dumb things to nitpick here like why would Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even allow Harry Potter to stay with the Dursley's family when he knows that they're horrible people. Honestly, the Dursleys could had killed Harry Potter with the childhood neglect! What was he thinking? Harry Potter could had commit suicide, or gone crazy like Lord Voldermort! What an idiot! The whole movie is about children being danger all the time. I don't care if they're wizards in training, I'm surprise that the death tolls of students dying isn't as high as it should be. The school staff is questionable at times. A good example of this stupidity, is punishing students whom went out at nights, by sending them out at nights in the dark forest, where they can get attacked by creatures. The most insulting thing in logic is the black/white one-dimensional view of good Vs evil. Honestly, how on earth is the members of Slytherin never got expulsion for all the bullies that it has? You would think, that at less, there would be one good person in Slytherin. Another thing that bugs me is the whole the power of love conquer all. I think, children are a lot smarter than the childish message, the film is trying to pull. The acting in the movie is pretty bland, for the most part. After all, most of the child actors had this film as their first roles. I wouldn't say that Harry Potter's film series, have the most entertaining of dialogues, anyways. The wooden delivery, felt like a read-through. Most of what they're saying are stating the obvious or repeating what happening on screen. It's so annoying. The other actors were master British thespians, who seem to over-act at times. A good example of this is John Hurt & Alan Rickman. It was too hammy for already over the top world. The action scenes were pretty well-done. My favorite had to be the Quidditch match and the whole chess game. I can do, without the whole troll scene. The CGI troll hasn't aged well. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. I love the special effects, locations & set, and costume, they did. It really made the Harry Potter world, stand out. The music by John Williams is amazing to listen to. I think director Chris Columbus was indeed the best choice for this first movie, as he got the magically part, right and how to make a family picture. You even see, how much things, he establish that other directors would reused time after time. Still, I really hope for Terry Gilliam like J.K Rowling's first choice to be the direction. The movie has great social commentary themes like the metaphor of racism, ethnic cleansing and why Nazism is bad. You can also see possible influences from other words, that made Harry Potter work. There was a few controversial moments leading up to the film, like religious debates. A few religious groups claim that Harry Potter contain occult or Satanic subtexts that isn't good for children. Another one is the use of the word, sorcerer over the word philosopher in the title. US & British have different meanings to the words, plus marketing though, it would better to call it sorcerer as that word get more appeal. Due to this different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name had to be reshot, once with the actors saying ""philosopher's"" and once with ""sorcerer's"". Overall: The movie might has its flaws, but majority, a great first watch for any fantasy fan.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

","Harry Potter movies are one of my favorite ones, and I can watch them several times.

I also want to mention that even my family members like to watch it with me. My grandmother especially likes it. This fact indicates that this movie is interesting not only for children but also for elderly people and it's not weird for me. There are so many things going on in this movie, so many secrets and beautiful scenes. Plus a big thanks for the graphics of the movie, everything is very realistic. For example, the mermaids or the dinosaurs. Moreover, there is a massive animatronic creature in this movie- spider and after watching the movie google about it and found out that Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron Weasley, one of the main characters, is afraid of spiders just s much as his character is, and said it was easily the scariest scenes to film. I'm scared of spiders too, and I know how it feels when you see them. Thus, I really appreciate the job that this actor did. In my opinion, despite the fact that he had to play again a guy, who was scaring from spiders, it is again hard to play the role by looking at the creature that gives you goosebumps.

It's a delight to watch, I've seen this movie numerous times and it never fails to make me smile, to cheer me up when I'm feeling down, the Harry Potter franchise is magical both inside and out, and it's simple fun to watch Harry go in to his first year at Hogwarts, the story's quite simple as the series kicks off with a light start, but it will still leave you wanting more. The films biggest flaw is, at times, it is too faithful to the book that it is based off, I'm sure this is pleasing for anyone who's read the book, but for those who haven't it tends to drag out at times, more than an hour passes before Potter even goes to Hogwarts and the main adventure dosen't unfold properly until at least one hundred minutes in, it can get a little tedious at times and that's why I'm giving it an eight instead of a nine that it easily could have received. The cast is outstanding, the young cast members are ridiculously talented for their age, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have no trouble playing a lead role, and both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson shine as his closest friends, they never lose a single bit of likability. They are joined by a terrific adult cast, including the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and, the highlight of the movie for me, Richard Harris, he shines as Professor Dumbledore (sadly only for two movies), his characterization is perfect, he is wise, heartwarming and simply a lovable character.

26 December 2017,davidneuhoff,8," The best that it could have possibly gotten
","There is a major difference between reviews here and this is very easy to explain. Anybody who (like me) has read the books multiple times, knowing the slightest details and loving absolutely everything from the series, can´t be completely happy with the film. For the neutral watcher who read the books maybe once or not even at all this movie must seem like a really entertaining and well directed film. The problem is that though very good acting, especially Alan Rickman as Snape, a beautiful scenery and very good camera work, the most important essentials of the books are pretty much non-existing. For instance, I, as an hardcore fan since the first time reading the books when i was 9, was always extremely interested in reading a passage of a normal school lesson or a normal day at any job of an fully educated wizard, eg in the ministry of magic. Rowling made us have the desire to always experience more of the universe she created. I was always amazed by the lightness and uncomplicated way of Rowlings writing, how she managed to let us accompany Harry in his daily life, making the actually extremely strange and funny way of the magicians life seem so normal and casual for the readers. The film on the other hand is more of a build-up to Harry´s first encounter with Voldemort, a scene that´s perfectly directed with impressive effects and good filming, which is definitely the highlight of as well film and book, with the difference that the book is more focused in describing Harry´s adventrous first year as a whole. The film is a little bit inconsistent in terms of how close it sticks to the book´s plot and this is another problem. Because of the book being so comprehensive and full it is nearly impossible not to skip any sections of the book. In my opinion the screenwriter should have either sticked closer to the book or distanced the filmplot more from it. Another thing i miss is the great dry humour the book is spiced with in a lot of ways. The problem is that this can´t really be translated in the movie because it´s often in the way Rowling describes things and not only in the dialogues. One thing that is awesome is the music. In my opinion John Williams is the best film music composer and the way he captures the mysterious and thrilling atmosphere and the majesty and greatness of Hogwarts is marvelous. At the end I can say that the film can meet the expectations but it´s just not possible to convince a haerdore fan completely, just because while reading the book, everybody creates his own picture of Hogwarts, the characters and the scenery. This is called imagination, it is the best part of reading a book, not possible to be translated completetly satisfyingly into a movie and the reason to my big recommandation concerning Harry Potter and also every other book which is filmed. Read the book first! If you watch the film first and read the books afterwards you´ll miss a great time imagining everything for yourself.

Chris Columbus was criticised for being too slavishly faithful to the book but in my view that was just the right approach. The movie presented Harry Potter's world exactly the way I had envisioned it. The cast was perfect, the tone was perfect, the visuals were perfect. Granted, the book is richer and funnier (Rowling has a very British, wicked sense of humour) but it is ultimately a children's book with a universal message about the value of love, friendship and courage, so, in my opinion, veering towards a darker, more grotesque feel would have been a mistake.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

This film has good camera work. It has current state effects. It has a pace akin to running a 24fps film at 1000fps. It's shallow- it asks you to buy into all of it without explanation. There's a fakeness to it leaving me feeling like I had molten Saran-wrap poured over me. I don't care about the characters because they were simply place-holders- no personalities. Harry is so two-dimensional as to make a sheet of paper more intriguing. Perhaps the ""genre"" just doesn't appeal here.

","This to date is the only Harry Potter film I have sat through and watched from start to finish. I have seen bits and pieces of the others, but watching them I just feel the same thing that I did when I watched this one. In a word 'bored'. The only thing that kept me entertained was the scenery and seeing the many British A and B list stars. The most enjoyment I got out of the film is saying ""its the villain from Die Hard! he must be a bad guy!"", ""That's the dude who got messed up by Gene Hackman in Unforgiven!"", ""he was in a couple of Bond films!"", and you get the idea. The film features Harry Potter going to wizard school for the first time. His aunt and uncle keep him living in a closet so going to wizard school or heck math camp would be a nice change of pace for the kid. Well when he goes to school he makes friends quickly with this lass and red headed boy and these three would grow up into some very poorly photogenic to old for the roles adults. Seriously, they looked like they were stoned on the DVD cover of Deathly Hallows and all three just do not look like the type of people you put in movies. Well Harry quickly becomes adept at the sport of wizardry Quiditch which involves flying around on a broom and scoring points. I know, when I hear flying brooms I think witches and witchcraft, but this is wizard school cause that is what the author says! There is also a bit of a mystery to be solved and an ending that will become very familiar with those who enjoy this series. I did not care for this one and I never continued following Harry's adventures, I am not going to fault those who do, this set of films just was not for me and man they are going on to long.

","Okay I'm gonna say this honestly, I absolutely love this movie. Take in mind that I've read the novels, I'm a big fan and I watched this movie for the first time when I was 10. This is a good adaptation of a great book, but I will say that the only thing that disappoints me now when I watch it is that I can't help, but imagine what it would have been like if JK's first choice of director had been picked (Terry Gilliam). Terry would have definitely been more creative and he probably would have brought something different to the table. I agree with British film critic Mark Kermode, Columbus does have a rather ""bland and straight-forward"" direction style. Now that may work in some movies, but not in a fantasy film like Harry Potter. I must say though in his defense that second movie was much better than the first one, and it seemed to be an improvement for Chris who was probably a lot more comfortable with his surroundings, and had a better relationship with the actors. Still both films are a bit bland in comparison to the rest of the franchise, most of all if we were to compare the first two, to the third one which was directed by the wonderful Alfonso Cuarón, who's style of direction is considerably different from Columbus'. Apart from the blandness the film is great fun for the whole family, and there's always a distinctive energy when you're watching a new HP flick in theaters with a bunch of enthusiastic fans. People are saying now that Twilight is going to replace HP, but I don't think so. The Twilight fan base is only a third of the HP fan base, and the film series is close to been the biggest franchise of all time, and I think they can actually accomplish that. There's great acting by everyone, most of all by the Golden Trio, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and the lovely Emma Watson. Also stand out performances by Maggie Smith as the strict but fair Professor McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as the ""greasy git"", also known as Professor Snape. Richard Harris excels as the Headmaster of Hogwarts Academy, Dumbledore. He plays Harry's mentor to a tee. And I have to say I sorely miss him even if Gambon is doing a great job as his replacement.

","When I watched this movie at the first time I wasn't really aware what is it about. I was only ten years old, at the age when everyone believes that magic is real, that his or her own fantasies and most wild dreams can finally come true.
As I remember this film was one of the first films arranged for children around 7-12 years old, so it was like present for me.
Set in early nineties, this story takes place in London. The plot revolved around Harry Potter, whose parents where murdered by one of the greatest dark wizards of all time Lord Voldemord. Despite the fact that he was with his mother when she died, he survived, the fact that made him famous in wizarding world. He used to live with his cruel relatives, Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, but now he is about to leave their house to learn magic in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Daniel Radcliffe, actor who played titular protagonist, despite the fact that he was only twelve when first of Harry Potter movies released, could perfectly show all emotions little Harry felt all over this story. As movie about magic, it is exciting and breathtaking, with perfect decorations and interesting plot twists. It has bewitching magical effects, that makes you believe in reality of what is happening. A bonus is perfectly matched themes, like well-known ""Hedwig Theme"". The adventures of little boy and his friends will grab you out and never leave you until movie ends.

","The first of the popular books by J.K. Rowling was one of the most anticipated films at the time, and it became one of the most successful family films in cinema, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire). Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has lived with his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and their son since he was a baby. Then one day, after attacks by letters for him, Rubeus Hagrid (BAFTA nominated Robbie Coltrane) takes Harry to be taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He takes money from the Wizard Bank and buys a wand from Mr. Ollivander (John Hurt) on the way, and he also finds out he is famous for surviving an attack by He Who Must Not Be Named, explaining the scar on his forehead. When Harry is on his way to Hogwarts at London Liverpool Station he needs to find Platform 9 and 3 quarters, and asking Mrs. Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) he goes through a wall between platforms 9 and 10. On the train he meets Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and briefly Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson). Then at the school, they meet Professor Minerva McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith), the mean Slytherin bound Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), before going in front of Professor Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and the other teachers to be put into the appropriate houses by the wizard hat. The film continues to see their lessons with teachers, including Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) teaching potions, Madame Hooch (Zoë Wanamaker) teaching broom flying, and Professor Flitwick (Leprechaun's Warwick Davis, also playing Goblin Bank Teller) teaching levitation. Then is the first and (then) gripping Quidditch game, Gryffindor vs. Slytherin with Harry as the seeker trying to catch the Golden Snitch to win the game, while everyone scores with the Quaffel. But as time goes by, Harry, Ron and Hermoine discover a plan to steal something guarded by the giant two-headed dog (Fluffy), that they later find out is called the Philosopher's Stone (the Americans insist on calling the boring Sorcerer's Stone). Harry and the other two eventually pluck up the courage to get past the dog, and traps, including Devil's Snare plants, flying keys (to the door) and the giant game of Wizard's Chess. Harry eventually faces his great foe, and he suspected the very mysterious Snape, but it was in fact Professor Quirinus Quirrell (Ian Hart), but the real villain is on the back of his head, Harry's parents killer Vodermort, aka He Who (well, you know the rest). Harry survives and kills Voldermort and Quirrel, is reunited with his friends, Gryffindor deservedly wins the house cup, and Harry goes home with great memories. Also starring John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick and David Bradley as Argus Filch. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Music for John Williams, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Feature Film (Children's Award), Best Special Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design and Best Sound.

23 July 2005,uckpshh,1," Hollywood's greatest shame.
","At first I liked the Harry Potter series, it was imaginative, it was original, it was funny, and it had promise. Then the second one came out, ""oh WOW this is heaven, it can't get better than this"", then the third came out, ""I was wrong about the second, because this is awesome"". Then in between finishing the third and the release of the fourth I read the Lord of the Rings. And shortly after, the movies for both came out. I realized the huge difference, I was psyched out when I heard they were making a Harry Potter movie, but there they go and ruin it. Did you know Spielberg was originally supposed to direct, until Miss Rowling insisted it HAD to be an all British cast, in walks in Chris Columbus, a guy who directed Robin Williams in becoming a woman in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", and a guy who's obviously willing to give in to any demand thrown at him by the author as long as he makes money. Well Mr. Columbus seemed to direct Ron into acting like a woman as well. You throw in a B list of child actors and a list of acclaimed adult actors who are far past their prime and who only opted to make these films because their grandchildren begged them to, and you have the first Harry Potter movie. There has never been a more horrific performance than that of Rupert Grint, who now dominates the worst performances of all time, kicking Jake Lloyd from The Phantom Menace out of the way. Daniel Radcliffe doesn't really possess much talent either, I highly doubt he has any future after this film, as far as acting goes anyways. As for Emma Watson, who thinks she's the best in the world, and if you think I'm talking about her performance as Hermione, you're dead wrong, have you listened to her in interviews? The room can barely fit the three of them; her, the interviewer, and her ego. Her performance is also astonishingly bad. I forgot to mention the horrible special effects, I have seen better on TV watching ""Power Rangers"". I mentioned the Lord of the Rings earlier to make reference to the obvious ripoffs of Miss Rowling. Firstly there are the dementors, cloaked ghostlike figures whose faces you never see (cough, RINGWRAITHS!). The whomping willow seems to ring a bell (ENTZ). The Giant Spider named Aragog (SHELOB). The trolls also seem to resemble something I've seen before... OH YEAH, the trolls in Lord of the Rings! Hopefully Warner Bros. choice of hiring different directors for the rest of the films will pay off. But this is the perfect example of a book that could have made an Oscar worthy classical movie, but fell short because instead of making it what it was intended to be they chose to skimp on the effects to make more money on little kids who think it's great because they're too young to watch real special effects in Star Wars or LotR. It really makes me sad, because in the months prior to the first movie I was marveling at the promise of it all. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, they got John Williams to do the score, and like that, it was ruined. Although it does seem that my opinion differs from the rest of the world as Miss Rowling is just raking it in and so are the filmmakers, making even more money by skimping on the special effects that will no doubt succeed in dazzling children who aren't yet potty trained.

I tried to like it, but I found it excruciating to watch.  It took me no where and, even worse, it really didn't have much of a plot.  The thin shreds of plot were introduced 1 hour and 45 minutes into the film.  The first part of the film was obviously conceived to give a background to the viewer of the Potter world.  Unfortunately there was little to grip me here and I found most of it to be grossly out of place.  What the heck does a game of ""Quidditch"" have to do with the story?  It, and many other things, were just eye candy.  The characters were stale and seemed like rejects from a Roald Dahl story (see James and the Giant Peach).

","Excessive and nearly completely tedious first installment in the sure-to-be long running series. The famous books come to life on the silver screen with ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"". Young Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is recruited to Hogwart's School to learn the arts of being a wizard. He immediately makes friends in Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, but nothing seems quite right. The titled stone, guarded by a three-headed dog, appears to be the target of one of the faculty members at the academy. It must be shady professor Alan Rickman, right? Chicago critic Richard Roeper called this ""The Wizard of Oz"" of this film-going generation, but really come on. This movie is not in the galaxy of films as the aforementioned production. Early success here gives way to a nearly unending running time and special effects that could tire more than interest. Rickman, along with legitimate performers like Maggie Smith, John Cleese, Warwick Davis, John Hurt and Richard Harris get shoved aside by ugly visual effects and the film's three adolescent leads (behaving like mischievous brats throughout). Director Chris Columbus (a film-maker that somehow continues to work on big budget junk) continues to show shortcomings and I think the scope of the book and the film are just way too much for him and the performers. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back.

13 April 2009,robert-temple-1,9," Nicolas Flamel Strikes Again
","As the first of the famous Harry Potter films, this one managed to restrain its special effects sufficiently not to overwhelm the viewers with too many dazzling visuals at the expense of the story and the amusing characters. The result is most entertaining, and Emma Watson was perfectly cast as the character Hermione. The production is full of famous actors, some recognisable, some not. Robbie Coltrane is particularly effective and endearing, with a broad Somerset accent, of all things! Maggie Smith has little to do but wrinkle her nose. But there is little point in discussing a production which has been reviewed to death and talked about until everyone has lost their breath, and there is nothing to add about all that. In America, this film title used the phrase 'sorcerer's stone' because Americans were presumably considered too ill-educated to know what the Philosopher's Stone is. In Britain and Canada, the title used the correct phrase of 'the Philosopher's Stone'. The Philosopher's Stone (correctly shown in the film as being red in colour) is reputed to have existed, but no one is certain. It was the end-product of alchemy, and had the ability to turn all metals into gold if you sprinkled a little of it on, say, lead, for instance. It also could produce a medicine to allow you to live indefinitely in good health, perhaps for centuries. J. K. Rowling sticks some genuine esoterica into her stories sometimes, and in this one she incorporated the fourteenth century alchemist Nicolas Flamel, whose presumed dates are sometimes given as 1330-1418. He really existed, and his tombstone may be seen in the Musee de Cluny in Paris, on the left as you go up a staircase, affixed to a wall. The staff of the Museum either do not know or pretend not to know who Flamel is, and 'if ye seek ye shall not find', as they all look blank. As far as I know, I may be the only person who has fully deciphered the symbology of this strange stone. Flamel faked his own death to avoid arrest and imprisonment by the French king, who wanted to keep him captive and force him to make gold for him. The tombstone was designed by Flamel himself before he disappeared. For a long time it rested in place in the nave of the Paris church of Saint-Jacques la Boucherie, but that church was demolished long ago, with only its high tower remaining. The Tour Saint-Jacques has now had its scaffolding removed, and is looking splendid and clean. It has long been the symbol of modern French esotericism (which the French call esoterisme), and a famous French esoteric periodical even bore its name. The tombstone was salvaged from the demolition and used for many years, turned upside-down, as a chopping-board for herbs, by a herb-seller in his shop. It was recognised in the 19th century and preserved by an antiquary. The old stone house of Flamel, known as 'the oldest house in Paris', still stands and you can go and eat there in a small and expensive restaurant called after Flamel. There are even two little streets in the vicinity of the Tour named Rue Nicolas Flamel and Rue Perenelle, the latter of which is named for his wife and alchemical collaborator. In the film, Flamel is said still to be alive, and the Stone is his, although he does not appear in the story himself. What happened to Flamel, who was Fulcanelli, all of these things are continuing mysteries which are far more interesting than any J. K. Rowling story. Nevertheless, it is good that young people are being given a small dose of these things in palatable form by Rowling, as it might open their minds, if they can stop texting trivia to each other for long enough to allow their minds to be opened, that is.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first film in the epic ""Harry Potter"" series, directed by kiddie-movie specialist Chris Columbus, feels a bit slight compared to some of the stories that followed it, but there are many delights here for both Potter fans and fantasy movie fans in general. The fun of the movie always feels a bit contrived and forced, which I think is mostly the fault of the director. But on the other hand a wonderful cast was brought together for this film, a cast which formed the core of the solid ensemble that carried through the rest of the film series (so far).

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was released in close proximity to the great Lord of the Rings, and while this has happened many times before with the general result that one of the two films is widely, although not always correctly, considered inferior to the other (Independence Day and The Arrival, Armageddon and Deep Impact, etc.), this has surprisingly not been the case with these films. Clearly, The Lord of the Rings is a much more mature and bold film, but the first installment in the Harry Potter series is much more than a childish adventure tale. One of the things that really makes it a great film is that the film is so faithful to the book. The writers and director Chris Columbus wisely decided not to take any creative liberties with the material that they had to work with. I am glad to see this, because literary faithfulness is almost always associated with better adapted films, and it's good to know that no one involved with the making of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone felt the need to improve upon a book that has been justifiably described as a `publishing phenomenon.'",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

","''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a red-blooded adventure movie, dripping with atmosphere, filled with the gruesome and the sublime, and surprisingly faithful to the novel. A lot of things could have gone wrong, and none of them have: Chris Columbus' movie is an enchanting classic that does full justice to a story that was a daunting challenge. The novel by J. K. Rowling was muscular and vivid, and the danger was that the movie would make things too cute and cuddly. It doesn't. Like an ""Indiana Jones"" for younger viewers, it tells a rip-roaring tale of supernatural adventure, where colorful and eccentric characters alternate with scary stuff like a three-headed dog, a pit of tendrils known as the Devil's Snare and a two-faced immortal who drinks unicorn blood. Scary, yes, but not too scary--just scary enough. Three high-spirited, clear-eyed kids populate the center of the movie. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter, he with the round glasses, and like all of the young characters he looks much as I imagined him, but a little older. He once played David Copperfield on the BBC, and whether Harry will be the hero of his own life in this story is much in doubt at the beginning. During ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I was pretty sure I was watching a classic, one that will be around for a long time, and make many generations of fans. It takes the time to be good. It doesn't hammer the audience with easy thrills, but cares to tell a story, and to create its characters carefully. Like ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""Star Wars"" and ""E. T.,"" it isn't just a movie but a world with its own magical rules. And some excellent Quidditch players.

The movie, which tells how a seemingly normal boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), discovers he is actually a wizard and starts attending a school named Hogwarts, encountering many dangers throughout his first year, isn't boring for a second during its 146 minutes, but the pace is occasionally slowed down because, like in other ""part 1 of 3"" movies (actually, they're supposed to be 7), the director spends a lot of time introducing and explaining things, so he won't have to do it in the sequel(s).

31 December 2020,fernandoschiavi,8," A film visually full of colors and very entertaining for the whole family, with a lot of humor, adventure, mystery, thriller and full of lessons in friendship and moral
","It all started in 1990 when J.K.Rowling had the idea about a boy with glasses and black hair, it popped into his head during a train ride from Manchester to London. She has since gone on to work on her first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and on a plan that included the plots of each of the seven books she planned to release. In the years that followed Rowling had her daughter, divorced her first husband and moved to Portugal, always continuing to write the book. Finally, in 1996, the book was ready, and after eight publishers rejected the manuscript, Bloomsbury agreed to publish it the following year. After its publication, the Harry Potter series gained great popularity and commercial success worldwide and gave rise to films, video games, among others.
The great merit of J.K. Rowling that led the series to be so popular with young people is the construction of an intensely pleasant hero and puts his adventures on paper by mixing great dark adventures with light drama and pleasant comedy. It is this same essence and tone that director Chris Columbus employs in this first adventure of the wizard boy, and he does it very well. Usually fans of some work adapted to the cinemas always end up complaining about omitted facts. But this is not the case. Steve Kloves' script is incredibly faithful to Rowling's book. All the remarkable passages for the readers are present and finally manage to cease the curiosity of how everything would be.
Steve Kloves' script is the result of meticulous work and should have been nominated for several awards as the best script adapted to that year's Oscar. It keeps all the main passages in the book and many of the characters' speeches come straight from the pages of the book to the mouths of their interpreters.
Most of the changes mentioned are natural in adaptations from one medium to another, but what gives the clear feeling that the film is just a clipping of the book's events to the screens giving the feeling of being an episodic film is the plot involving Nicolau Flamel , of essential importance to the drama, and which is mentioned only in the final part of the film, somewhat out of obligation so that all passages of the climax were justified. On the other hand, it should be noted that this first film is about introducing the complex universe of the series to the public. For this reason, Columbus loses the necessary time to introduce the protagonist to the audience (his past history, who he is, how he lives) and the personality characteristics of dozens of other characters, in addition to having to mention several terms and an infinity of scenarios from the wizarding world that the audience gets to know along with Harry throughout the scenes. It is a film that pleases by its ability to be faithful to the book and to consolidate the fundamental bases for films released in the future. For this reason, we have to see Harry still at the Dursleys' house to get to know them better and to know what life was like for the young wizard with his uncles and to give us a sense of the powers that were then unknown to Harry, such as his ability to communicate with snakes. Only afterwards are we introduced to the gigantic and expansive settings at Hogwarts, and then meet the teachers and the various classes they teach. Then we watch Harry and his friends develop over a whole year at school until he can face his first big challenge at the end of the school year (even several of the final challenges use the knowledge they learn in class).
The unknown cast of children proved to be the right choice and that was fundamental, since the expectation of success of the film and the permission for the development of the following films was enormous. If a casting choice was wrong, we would have to live with it until the end of the saga. Emma Watson is the perfect Hermione Granger, the little witch daughter of parents who are not wizards and who is extremely studious and smart, and certainly the most intelligent for her age. Who knew that girl would be in the future one of the best actresses and one of the most beautiful of her generation. Rupert Grint also proved to be the best choice to be Ron Weasley. The young actor with natural red hair is one of those who best embodies the character and his clumsy, comical and friendly way. His facial expressions are also priceless. Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest in performance of the main trio, precisely the great protagonist. But even so, his work is very satisfying and only gets better throughout the series. The chemistry of this trio on the scene made them a reference and the success of the features made them three of the richest young people in the world. We also have other highlights like Harry Melling as Duda Dursley, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Matthew Lewis as the clumsy and priceless Neville Longbottom.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

Not having read any of the books, but only having brief information fed to me by  my 9-year old I was unprepared for what this movie was really about.  I believe this character appeals to kids because #1 - he's from a broken home (like many young kids today), #2 - he's fighting against the evils of the world everyday(like many kids are at this age - trying to figure out what's right and wrong), #3 - it's fun (there was a tremendous game played at Hogwart's where the characters are flying on broomsticks where the pace is very fast like many video games that kids play today), #4 - the class mentality displayed at Hogwart's(similar to school rivalry's just blossoming with kids these days), and finally #5 - Harry wins and wins by playing by the rules(most of the time).  This is even fun  to watch for old-timers like myself (even though I had to get tips from my 9-year old every once in a while about what was happening on-screen, which she gave me unsolicited every couple minutes).

Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert show in the very first version of the franchise how talented they are, and I'm pretty sure production team already knew they would never disappoint-- and in fact, they never did. ""Sorcerer's Stone"" the whole time tries to make you believe Snape is the bad guy, giving clues he's the one trying to steal the stone-- when in fact, it's another random professor. Special effects are decent for such year it's been released, but for the high budget they had I thought it could be a little more realistic at times.

This lavish film version ends up working on both levels: as a stand-alone motion picture and as a worthy adaption of a novel that,while hardly a literary landmark,is nevertheless brilliantly funny,inventive and full of imaginary spunk. Director Chris Columbus has a deserved reputation for making cloying films(Home Alone,Mrs. Doubtfire and Bicentennial Man),but here he has deftly allowed the movie to carefully walked the precious line between being too syrupy for adults and too grave for children(there are some very scary scenes here that may be too intense for those under the age of 12 since the film carries a stern ""PG"" rating). In other words,this movie is way,way,COOL! Even though it was just a flick for the kiddies,it was spectacle beyond belief.

After seeing it the second time I felt compelled to give this movie some kind of kudos. This is a very stunning and charming journey through a fantasy world which captured the entire world by storm. In my opinion this was the best of all the other installments. Why? I guess it's because everything was so new and the kidswell they were such cute little rascals. They were just itty-bitty things and waving around their magic sticks. How cool it that? I am not saying the early sequels were not bad they just didn't measure up to the freshness of the original. I will also have to say that the later oneswell the sell-by date had expired and the storyline was beginning to stink of political correctness. It is too bad the author's social views spilled into a perfectly good adventure series. But that is the choice of the stories' creator. I guess fame and money tends to unveil hubris and opinions.

In Harry's case this takes place at the Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is to become a great wizard, like Luke becomes a powerful Jedi. Along the way, we learn that there is a very powerful and seductive ""dark side"" to Magic. Ultimately the path is a choice or perhaps a sacrifice. Harry feels alone and incomplete-- he yearns for his dead parents. The whole scene with Harry sitting in front of the Mirror of Erised and speaking with Richard Harris as Dumbledore (Hogswart Headmaster) made it for me. Dumbledore says that men have gone mad looking into the Mirror living their dreams, ""...forgetting to live."" Great stuff. Looks like the other books may be darker as Harry seeks out the man responsible for murdering his parents.

As befits the length of Harry Potter books this film is long, and that means it has the opportunity to luxuriate in introducing characters and situations while slowing building the final elements of danger into the plot. One of its greatest strengths is the detailed vast, and appealing parallel fantasy world that it creates for its characters.

There are so many short cuts taken in this movie, little scenes and bits of dialogue taken out that you lose a sense of coherence. The characters have been simplified as well, giving us bland versions of the characters in the books. I saw this movie before reading the books and wasn't impressed. I took an interest after the second film, which is more faithful and adds some depth. This is just bright, shiny, and simple. Having said that though, the story is so good that even simplified it still works. The special effects, especially the troll, are not up to par for a major studio movie. The cast is quite good, littered with strong, veteran actors to back up the young leads. The leads are not as great in this film as they are in the sequel with a film under their belts. All in all a good effort, but the screenwriter should have stayed closer to the characters in the book and the tone of the film is light. The humor of the book is almost completely torn apart.

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone or if your from Europe the philosopher's stone. The story that started it all today marks the the films 20th anniversary. Harry Potter life changes forever when all of sudden he finds out that he's a famous wizard. So here we are at hogwarts school of witch craft and wizardry Where kids learn the fundamentals of the magic world. Here harry meets his bestest friends and from there on his life changes forever. While so much has happens in this franchise, the sorcerer's stone has alway held a top spot for me primary because of it's tone. As the the series went on each installment became more and more epic and serious. Though along with the chamber of secrets this helped build the world of Harry Potter as we know it now. This world magical and whimsical from the very first shot of hogwarts to the the great hall. Accommodate by John Williams soundtrack draw you into this setting, and looking back I can't but, love falling in love with this Cast. Not just for nostalgic feel but everybody gives a damn great performances. Especially Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint as Ron Harry and Hermione. These kid's sell the whole film from the way they play off each other to their three personalities. That moment they meet on the train you know right at that moment these three are going to be inseparable. Malfoy is such a conniving pompous little ass, you just really want to smack this boy. He's literally everything resent about his child with Dursleys cruel and Selfish. Every kid does a great job it's some of the best child acting ever. The hogwart staff are also great Maggie smith as professor Mcgonagall gives such this loving bearing grandma personality clearly someone who love her students and her job. Very strict,but is open to having fun. The late Richard Harris as Dumbledore who even though he was only in two film, I still remember his portrayal from the early content. He had this very traditional Merlin style and spoke with such a soft yet wise speaking voice. It has always made me wonder want Dumbledore would have been like if he was still around for the others films. Of course arguably everybody's favorite character in the whole series Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. Rickman clearly put his all into this character without a doubt his most famous role. He adds such this slimy malevolent charm to this character to the way he speak to the way he stares, before you even know his name you know this guy just gonna make everybody life hell. Also Hagrid I love Hagrid he such a big lovable oaf it can't be helped. While there's so much that this film has succeeded in making, it does have some gripes and minor issues. Firstly is the the pacing it does feel that in the middle of the film it can feel rather padded in a way and that primary because there's some much show and telling in the this film. It has to set up some much on how this school and this world works that it tend to seem a bit much in some parts. The Sorcerer's stone isn't mentioned until around an hour and a half in. The visuals as stated already are great from practical make and sets like the goblins and the chessboard are dedication to the craft. Though some of the cg while getting the job done for the time some does look rather off. The quidditch game make uses of it well with the field, in the game itself is epic and exciting, but when you have these fully computer generated bodies you can't help but notice them. CG is always been used for the Quidditch in these films, but here it doesn't hold up a bit as well now you can't help but just look at it.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2001,jhaggardjr,10," Magical masterpiece
","Here is the magical surprise of 2001. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the best movie that I've seen all year (so far). This I totally did not expect. This is a film that works not only on the level of special effects. It has a terrific story, wonderful characters, and a beautiful atmosphere. This was quite refreshing since so many of the movies today that feature special effects are weak on story and characterization. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the first movie in what is going to be a big movie series based on ""Harry Potter"" novels written by J.K. Rowling. So far four novels have been written with three more on the way. This movie has created so much hype that the second movie is already in the works. I think this is going to be a blockbuster franchise. The movie opens with the title character living with relatives that are cruel and heartless. Then Harry gets a letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and learns that he's a wizard. So he gets away from his despicable uncle, aunt, and cousin, and journeys to this special school to learn the tricks of his trade. Along the way he meets two young aspiring magicians who will become his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He also makes an enemy in Draco Malfoy, who is kind of like the evil version of Harry. The faculty of Hogwarts include wise headmaster Albus Dumbledore; huge groundskeeper Hagrid; Prof. McGonagall, who can transform into a cat and back to human form in a flash; Prof. Snape, who's sinister looks create fear in the students; Prof. Hooch, the broomstick instructor; and Prof. Quirrell, who wears what looks like a turban all the time and studders alot. There are alot of visual elements that work wonderfully in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". My favorite scene is the one where the students play the game of Quidditch. That is a fascinating special effects sequence that is kind of hard to describe but is fulfilling to watch. It kind of reminded me of the pod race in ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" with its effects going across the screen at a rapid pace. Another great scene in the movie is the one where the three kids play an unusual high stakes game of chess, where the huge game pieces come to life. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" works on every level. In addition to the excellent special effects, it works on the direction and screenplay. The director here is Chris Columbus, who's worked in this territory before as the director of the popular kids- oriented 1990 comedy ""Home Alone"" and its first sequel, 1992's ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"". He worked with kids again in the little more adult oriented 1993 Robin Williams blockbuster ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". These three hit movies directed by Columbus were more lighthearted in its tone, but Columbus has been in more darker territory before. His directorial debut came with ""Adventures in Babysitting"", the black comedy from 1987 that was filmed in Chicago and starred Elisabeth Shue. Before stepping into the director's chair, Columbus wrote a couple of screenplay's for a trio of Steven Spielberg productions: ""Gremlins"", ""The Goonies"", and ""Young Sherlock Holmes"". ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" bares a resemblance to each one of those movies in some way. Those virtuoso special effects scenes when those big chess pieces comes to life was very much like some of the special effects scenes in ""Young Sherlock Holmes"". This movie is like an ""Indiana Jones"" for kids; so was ""The Goonies"". This movie is scary and darker in tone; so was ""Gremlins"". Though unlike ""Gremlins"", ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" isn't violent. It's scary, but not over-the-line scary. Columbus was a good choice as director of this movie (Steven Spielberg had a chance to direct this, but passed on it to make ""A.I.""), and it's his best film as director to date. He's brought this movie to life in exhilarating fashion. The screenplay is by Oscar nominee Steve Kloves (""Wonder Boys""), who did a superb job in adapting the movie from the book. The cinematography, editing, production design, and costume design are all first-rate and deserve Oscar attention, along with the visual effects. The performances are picture perfect. The three kids who play Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all acting newcomers and they were all perfect choices to play these characters. I think we'll be seeing alot of Daniel Radcliffe in the future. Radcliffe portrays Harry Potter to absolute perfection. He holds the movie together in every scene, and was a natural choice to play this character. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are very exceptional as Ron and Hermione. Like Radcliffe, we'll be seeing alot of Grint and Watson for years to come. They're all terrific young British actors (and they've all been signed on to star in the next ""Harry Potter"" movie). You couldn't have asked for a better supporting cast than the one that's featured in this movie, all a who's who of veteran British actors. Richard Harris (as headmaster Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape), Robbie Coltrane (groudskeeper Hagrid), Zoe Wanamaker (Prof. Hooch), and Ian Hart (Prof. Quirrell) are all perfectly cast; with John Cleese, Warwick Davis, Richard Griffiths, John Hurt, Fiona Shaw, and Julie Walters featured in smaller roles. What a cast! I loved everything about ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". This is not just a movie for kids, but for the whole family. I've never read any of the ""Harry Potter"" books, but on the basis of this first ""Harry Potter"" movie, I think I'm going to go out and purchase the books. Or maybe ask to receive them as a Christmas gift. Speaking of Christmas, I think ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" will be the smash hit of the Christmas season 2001. If it doesn't surpass last year's Christmas hit, ""Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (which opened at exactly the same time a year ago), then the American moviegoing public has completely lost it. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" has gotten far better reviews that ""The Grinch"" movie did last year, and critically acclaimed movies deserve to be blockbuster hits alot more than critically hated movies like ""The Grinch"". From what I saw this weekend (a packed moviehouse and an opening day gross of $29.5 million), ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" will be a blockbuster smash.

I was doubtful if Columbus would be capable to go to darker places. I am happy to say that Columbus has stayed true to the source material in most ways.

Indeed, a friend of mine who has read the book was quick to point out that it was made simpler and more childish.

6 December 2001,supertom-3,6," Very entertaining!
","I used to, in fact I still do, love fantasy films for example Labyrinth, Masters of the universe, Princess bride and of course the first three star wars films. Fantasy films have the most imaginative of set designs and costumes and when done well take you to another world for 90 or so minutes. Since the 80's these films have dried up, very rarely are they released and even rarer now are they good. The last I can remember was Phantom Menace but that wasn't great, plus there is an overuse of effects to, I like to see an actor walking on a set for real. All of a sudden Harry Potter comes out which will be quickly followed by Lord of the rings. I went not knowing what to expect, I had heard 99% excellent reviews, but would this sort of film still appeal to me? answer yes. This film gets the balance between kids fun and subtley included adult jokes perfectly, it has moments of universal joy and the set designs are brilliant as are the effects, the effects thankfully are not overused either. Most films of this type would have an adult in the lead for the purpose really of experienced acting skills despite a child being more accessible for the younger audience, but thankfully the three principle child actors are good in their roles, the supporting cast of the younger generation range from average to quite wooden but they will get better with age. As a critic said the three main kids are not portrayed as to cutsie like the case might have been, aside from their magical skills they are seemingly you average run of the mill kids you see every day in the highstreet or whatever. Basically this film has a universal appeal and I would say is the first decent non cartoon fantasy of the 90's. Its solid entertainment. ***",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

In other words, her prefers stories which stick to the ribs as opposed to cotton candy which will melt away in the shadow of adulthood. For a blockbuster film filled with special effects HARRY POTTER has surprising zilch to offer as far as groundbreaking cinema.  We've all seen films about magic, broomstick flying, monsters, etc... and though the production values are far beyond that of a CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, they are not beyond that of SUPERMAN, and the story falls far from the film perfection of a MARY POPPINS or the classic literacy of C.S.Lewis.  The acting by the youngsters get the job done but don't expect to see much more of them (except for sequels), and the older famous counterparts give their usual professional turns that seem to be lifted from previous roles.  In essence, the hype of the books have carried over to carry the film.  The story line pales against the classics and there goes the real story.  Most college students would have a difficult time reading the classics by Verne, Stevenson, Homer, Melville(the original versions), and Harry Potter (a step above Dr. Seuss, but without the wit or satire) gives students a chance to say they have actually read a book that wasn't a comic book.  HARRY POTTER will be forgotten before the next generation arrives and be buried alongside PIPPY LONGSTOCKING in the LET'S-NOT-ADMIT-WE-ACTUALLY-ENJOYED-THIS crypt of forgotten lore.  But back to HARRY POTTER, a muddy muddle of a movie. England has never looked more drab, magic has never looked more insignificant, and Brits have never looked more stupid.

The settings, wardrobes, and props all carry ample weight in producing a magical atmosphere. Meanwhile, the iconic music sets an adventurous and mystical tone. Lastly, the casting is excellent. Most of the adults are extremely talented (namely Alan Rickman) and the children, despite their novice here, all became quite respected in their own rights.

When I was confronted with the opening of this movie, I wasn't really interested, thought it was too childish. But thenm there had to be a reason why the books appealed to children, adults, everyone. So when inevitably I saw this one, the result was an instant feeling of empathy towards it. I can only say that if they are trying to charm the viewer, if they are trying to involve him in the movie's sheer magic, they succeeded all the way. Now I understand why this one has so many fans. It is simply irresistible. It gives you something that you always search for when you go watch a movie - the power to be in another place for a few hours. And the movie delivers this and many more: all the production values are epic and magnificent, the John Williams score being a sort of conductor of all the emotions you experience when seeing this.

It isn't perfect and it's obvious that as the first instalment, it was unclear to the director and screenwriter as to what would work and what wouldn't. Sometimes it follows the novel too closely with some characters and ideas that overall could have been left out (the ghosts for example, do not play an important part in this first story) and at times it's awkward to have us bounce quickly in-between all of the classes the students attend. However, it does a good job of introducing us to this world, it has a lot of really memorable moments, a great cast and there's a lot of imagination here (some from the movie, some from the original book). I wouldn't say that my love for the Harry Potter series, both the films and the books influence me when I say that this is a good movie.

I really love the first half, especially the scenes with the Dursleys because they have such a hilarious relationship with Harry Potter. I also love the first scenes of Hogwarts, which was a mysterious welcome. Almost every second scene is iconic! The production design and the music often make the scenes very interesting and strange, and you can really feel the magic! Also the script is great, especially the funny parts. I think the story is good, but not just the story about Harry living at the school in general, but the ones about his parents, Albus Dumbledore, Voldemort, Severus Snape and the dark places. All of these characters and elements make a complex story, which is well done, I think. Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) and Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) played decent, but I think Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) did the best of the child actors. She really held onto her character. I liked the second half of the movie, but most of it contained the usual adventure and mystery scenes like other movies when it comes to open locked doors, find keys, solve puzzles, and face the danger in a brave way.

For example, the moving stairs. As for the things taken out or changes, I have no problem with all of them, except one. In the end when they're making their way through the various challenges, they took out Snape's potion riddle. To me, that was the second most important and memorable challenge of them all behind the chess challenge. This would've only added another minute or two and should've been included in the movie.

","I came to the film without having read the books. I had heard the movie followed slavishly to the novel but I reckoned if the movie was good enough, that shouldn't matter. So did the film feel like the adaption of a novel? Yes, very much so. It's obvious director Chris Columbus was scared of doing anything too radical with the material and so the movie tends to get bogged down at times. Certain elements in books do not translate well to movies unless done with a bit of flair - Columbus doesn't do this and so there is a certain weakness to the movie's structure. The acting isn't outstanding either among the kids. Daniel Radcliffe left as much of an impression on me as a battering with a soft feather would. It's not like he's from the dreadful Jake ""Phantom Menace"" Lloyd school of acting but he's entirely unremarkable all the same. Very forgettable performance. Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) are similarly perfunctionary and nothing more. The best performance is probably shared by Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) who really come across exactly what I would imagine from a kids book. The directing is perfectly competent and some of the action scenes are handled well - the quidditch match stands out most of all. Obviously Columbus was constrained by the material at hand and the target audience - I was hardly expecting to see Darren Aronofsky split-screen images of Hermione and Harry talking... The whole thing ends up like a well-done but by-the-numbers piece. No innovation here, no gambles. It was made to be as inoffensive as possible while trying to please as many.

7 November 2019,RhapsodyReviews,9," Great Film. Aged Well.
","Review:
'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is a fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus. It is based on the novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling and is the film is the first instalment of the Harry Potter film series.
This movie is so well done, and to me seems like it was ahead of its time.
Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has lived under the stairs at his aunt and uncle's house his whole life. But on his 11th birthday, he learns he's a powerful wizard -- with a place waiting for him at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As he learns to harness his newfound powers with the help of the school's kindly headmaster (Richard Harris), Harry uncovers the truth about his parents' deaths -- and about the villain who's to blame.
I would say that the casting of the film is perfect. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. They steal your heart and every scene they are in. Also, the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane make their characters likable.
Sometimes the visuals are better than others, but it was good for being made in 2001. The film has a big runtime, but the script is so tight it feels like it blows by.
Overall, anyone who loves fantasy films and worlds with great visuals, this film is for you. I go back to this movie all the time, and I highly recommend it.

Meeting the characters -- Harrym Hagridm Ron, Hermione, and the like -- is important, and in the film, they're fairly well established.

Of course, because it is a movie for children, the details and content of the film are very innocent and gentle, not too violent.

","I suppose as children's entertainment this film could be called good, but to anyone with a brain it is a messy, overindulged concoction of bad ideas and silly execution. I know nothing of the Potter books so this is based simply on the film. So much has been made of the books and film that I was predestined to be disappointed in some ways but little did I realize how trivial this movie is when cast against a powerhouse like The Lord of the Rings, really two completely different worlds. As with most modern tales of this type (HP) everything is so magical, everything moves (in some ways stupidly like the changing staircases) and it seemed so simple that no matter what issue that came up they all had an answer for everything. The worst part of the movie had to be the game played with balls and broomsticks. The whole point of having a separate game within a game is just retarded. Name one sport or game that has a special sideshow that can win the game at any moment? Imagine your team is about to win the Stanley Cup and their up 3 games to 1 and it's 4-0 with only a minute to go, but wait, don't forget there's a fan from each team playing a separate game in the men's room, and they just caught the golden plunger, so sorry your team has lost, too bad. Seems like JK's writing is a little on the light end don't you think? Why didn't the professor who is already through to the stone need to play the chess game like they did? What adults would announce the winners of a year long contest that meant so much to the kids, then seconds later say ""but wait, there's points that I forgot about""??? How cruel.

","I have previously posted a review for this film and I felt it wasn't long enough to show how much I enjoyed this film.At the time I typed that review,I had no idea what to put down.First of all,I would like to mention that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a film for the entire family and is almost 2hrs,30min or a little less of pure family entertainment.This film is enchanting in every way,providing excitement and fantasy for an entire audience and a is very surprisingly fun film to watch due to it's casting.I have never read any of the ""Harry Potter"" books because I knew that they were so big I would never catch up.The same thing with ""Superman:The Movie"".Never read the comics,although I looked at the pictures.Well,I read some of the comics but not all of them.I usually do not compare films to the novels or comics that they were adapted from because it wouldn't make sense for me.So I look at a book as a book and a movie as a movie.Alright,so far ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" attracted alot of audience members and is the kind of film I will see again.I think this film has a great chance come Oscar time for the Art Direction award.""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is in every way just as fun to watch tecnically and emotionally.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2020,e-67102-48412,10," Opened up a new world for me
","Think it's the best HP movie series ever made. The little actors are all too well chosen. Iron triangle was so cute when I was a child. Actually, I kind of grew up with Hp movies. Watching the little actors in the movie grow up, I am also growing up. Hp was the hardest memory of my childhood. Opened the door to the magical world of children, although it is no longer a surprise for its imagination of the fantasy world. Professor Snape and Quirrell warn our intuition not to think that what you think is what you think; that despite being a child's story, sometimes the intelligence and courage shown is admirable.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2004,atomius,," Not so harry potter as one would think.
","The thing with the film versions of the Potter books is that they are never like the books. Almost every scene is nothing like the words used in the book. For instance, in the end scene in the cavern with the giant mirrorof erised, Voldemort says that there is no evil or good, but power. However, in the book, it is Quirell who says that. The acting is questionable. I could rant on and on about the things i hate, but i might as well say the things that are good about it. I rate it 4/10. For a movie, 8/10. For a harry Potter adaption, 1/10. If you haven't read the novel you won't understand whats going on, but at least this one basically follows the plot line unlike Azkaban.

31 August 2015,barbagvido,7," Classic!
","The very beginning of a classic film franchise that many people (including me) call a big part of their childhood. When I was a kid, I loved this movie and watched it over and over again. I probably know all the lines in the movie. Then, when I was 14, I watched it again and this time, after reading the book (which is awesome, by the way) and while I enjoyed it as always because all the beautiful memories I get, I found some flaws. Most of them are about differences from the book but we can all say this part is one of the most faithful ones to the book. I will not say much about child actors considering that they were still unexperienced.Looking at them, I must say Emma Watson did the best job as Hermione Granger and Tom Felton was also really good as Draco Malfoy and he just makes you want to punch him in the face which is a good thing looking at his character. Now about adult actors. I think Maggie Smith did the best job as Harry's strict but awesome professor McGonagall. And I'll have to mention Alan Rickman that was really intimidating as professor Snape. I will not mention cast anymore because in my opinion everyone did good. Effects were fine for early 2000s but it doesn't look so good today. But there are some scenes that are still as thrilling as in 2001. But the most brilliant thing in this film is John Williams' beautiful score which totally brings me back to childhood and makes everything more magical. So, when you put everything together, it's a really entertaining fantasy every family should watch and the start of a great adventure.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2001,janyeap,," It's the Wonderful of Harry Potter...
","A truly engaging film that does applause the achievements of J.K. Rowlings! The storyline is phenomenally creative, yet simple enough to present a lesson of friendship, bravery and love. Truly a lovely and enchanting tale that focuses on good against evil, but without the usual condescending hoopla!   Unique in every aspect that will touch any child's imagination, bewildering them with a touch of Tom Brown School Days, Oliver Twist; and even Christmas Carol.  What makes a better story for children than a tale about an abused young orphan who gradually finds out that he has a lot to offer to his precious world?  Sure, this movie may not have the jaw-dropping appeal, craved by some.  But the GCI effects play well to pump up great charm, mystery, and bountiful of fun.  Watching the Quidditch match and the host of owls sweeping through the dining room is already worth the price of the tix!  The interior of Hogwart School is so unbelievably extravagant, from the dining room to the staircase and then to the common room.  I was simply mesmerized.  And Daniel Radcliffe is a welcomed Harry Potter. This young actor speaks with his eyes, and not with his gestures, and I love the way the camera focuses on his expressive eyes. He has the image of the sort of kid we would love to have in our home and school!   So idealistically pure, gentle and special even in mischief!  My only wish is to see him putting out more gusto with his humor and defiance as the book's Harry.  And the overall cast of actors?  Very delightful, and so true to the book characters!  Little Ron Weasley's performance is tops piping out cool and unexpected humor during the most insignificant times.  And Alan Rickman as Professor Snape: this guy actually sends chills down my spine!  Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid awesome: better than my image of the book character. And Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall strict, yet with a heart of gold! Yep, lots of actors in an amazing line-up of extraordinary portraitures! Thumbs up to Chris Columbus he certainly has the knack to grip even a six-year old child's attention.  Sure, there are scary parts, but created with taste for the kids in mind.  It's a fast paced movie that has certainly succeeded in bringing the wonderful world of Harry Potter to the silver screen!  Definitely a must-see movie for every child between the ages of six to fourteen, and for anyone longing for some magical moments in his/her life!",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

","Many viewers of this film applaud its faithfulness to the book, however they miss that while the film includes much of the book in it (more than is necessary in fact), it lacks the central story.  That is:  the story of a young boy who has suddenly had his wildest dream come true, and who now must deal with his newfound celebrity, his amazing magical heritage, and most of all, day to day life at Hogwarts with his friends (and enemies).  The movie is more preoccupied with populating Hogwarts with ghosts and moving staircases than it is with characters of any depth.  Everyone from the book, Harry included, suffers from a serious lack of on-screen development, and as a consequence the story lurches  ponderously from event to event without the throughline that stong character development would bring.

","So it's the one that started it all - also known as ""the one you can't really criticise because it started it all"". In other words, it makes me feel awful to have to say something negative about what is a good start to possibly the greatest film franchise of all time. But I want to be objective. So, I'll try to just get the negatives out the way firstly and quickly: the film definitely has not aged well. Its PS2-worthy graphics are sometimes laughable, particularly in the troll and Quidditch sequences. In addition, the film sometimes struggles to cram everything into the short space it has - for example, that the first act with the Dursleys is so short is both a curse and a blessing: we don't get to experience the nitty-gritty early years of abuse suffered by Harry that is so well documented in the books - but on the other hand, it just means we get to the magic of Hogwarts so much faster. And finally, on a negative point, its decidedly light and almost twee tone makes it very much child-friendly, but may cause the adults to lose interest now and then.

4 January 2023,IrateTyrant,8," Overacted and confusing
","This movie outright bored me. It's a story about a child in sorcery school, but it was filled with the same amount of shenanigans as any other Saved by the Bell episode. The magic he used came with alright and passable special effects, and some of the ideas that the script played around with were interesting such as Quidditch but even then, the execution of the scenes was patchy and confusing. I think it was made for those who had read the books, which are lengthy children's books I wouldn't waste my time with, personally. The actors are alright, but as children they have the capacity to overact way too much. Overall, I didn't really enjoy the series as a whole, at all.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just loved every second of it. Sure some of the effects are dated, some of the child acting is a bit weak and the film is filled to the brim with cliches story wise, but I still loved this. The world-building is phenomenal, and I love getting to see this world alongside Harry. It makes him a lot more relatable character. Speaking of the characters, this must have the best set of characters. Ron, Hermione, Draco, Hagrid, Dumbledore - it must be illegal to have so many iconic characters in one film. But the clear standout is Alan Rickman's phenomenal take on Snape. His performance is undoubtedly fantastic, but it reaches a whole other level when you know the outcome of his character. The twist is honestly pretty good here - let's just say 8 year old me was very shocked when Quirrell was revealed. Some of the effects are dated, but the action on the whole is really well shot and perfectly captures the whimsy of this world. The production design is immaculate, and I haven't even mentioned the magnificent score from John Williams, which might just be one of my all time favourites. Overall, my love for this film and this franchise will never decrease over time.

I first saw the movie with my family, who've all read the books. But my youngest sister, Kelly, is the biggest fan. After the movie she was telling me all the things that were different or left out. I jokingly asked her, ""So, you didn't like the movie?""...to which she replied that it was her favorite movie of all-time. That alone, tells me that the movie succeeded. I enjoyed the movie myself and think it's a fun fantasy story that's good for the whole family. The director, Chris Columbus, did a nice job and the actors, especially the kids, were great.

","This movie was lacking something. If I think hard enough, I bet I'll remember... Oh, yes, it's lacking exactly what its book counterpart had. Imagination. The book was really good; however, the movie... well, you can see that I gave it a 4. The movie's climax was awful. It was almost as if J. K. Rowling was trying to make this movie into a big mystery rather than an adventure. It was some mystery in the book--but not as much as in the movie. The climax in the book was built solidly on evidence and perfectly fitting pieces. However, the movie had cut-off puzzle pieces that were thrown together in the end and somehow expected to be understood. I would also expect better from John Williams (the guy who composed music for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, etc.). I hate to say it, but this music was awful. There was only one spot in which the music fit into the movie and sounded good, and it was toward the end of the movie. John Williams tried too hard to make it sound ""magical"", I think.

","It is a poorer world without books. When I went to see 'HPATPS' none 0f my family had read more than a few pages of any of JK Rowling's books. I had tried in vain to persuade my two children to become interested in reading. So, I thought, the film may do the trick, and it may just have done that. They are actually threatening to READ it now. Phew! I may even have a go myself. I suspected that the four of us were in a minority in the cinema, not knowing hardly anything about the story. The hype suggested that those 'not in the know' would struggle to follow the opening 30 minutes. I have to report that this warning was superfluos as we all seemed to know exactly what was happening! The money was obviously well spent, and, although I am not a lover of computer effects, they were handled sensitively and sensibly.Dare I suggest that the story did seem to slightly drag in the middle somewhere, but it was always entertaining, because of the fact that everything was wonderful to look at. The fine cast were great, although I kept expecting Alan Rickman to 'let rip', until the end, when I realised why he hadn't! It is the three children, however, who outshone Britain's Best. All 3 are magnificent in their roles, especially Emma Watson, who stole the film for me. My thanks to the director, who, if this film does prompt my children to read, will have, like his namesake, have proved that the world really is round, and not square. Another good thing to come from this film is that the '12' certificate is completely unnecessary. If Harry Potter gets a 'PG' then I can't think of another '12' film I've seen which does not deserve likewise. This was scary at times.

And then one fine day, I saw this computer game of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I enjoyed playing it and it was through the game I came to know the story of Harry Potter. I felt that it was so brilliantly done. I began to wonder whether it was the creativity of the game designers that created this world or was it the sheer genius of the author to make us imagine such a world. I decided to find out and finally read the book. And it was then I realized that Rowling had indeed created a whole new world for us and so fresh it was.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

Even though there was more in the book than the movie, most of the characters in the movie were exactly how I pictured them.  Hermione even *sounded* like I pictured her! I can't stand all the religious controversy. There is no evil ulterior motive. Harry and friends are good wizards fighting the evil Voldemort and his nasty cronies. It's about good versus evil and the good coming out on top. It teaches children to be good. When you see children dressed up for parties they're dressed as Harry and friends - not Voldemort! As a white witch myself, I practice magick in my daily life for good, peace, harmony and abundance, and to honour the Earth and the ancient ways.  I never use magick for evil, harm or to manipulate others. Although the magic in Harry Potter is make believe it is encouraging to note that people are realising that good magic is not evil. I have seen the movie and read the books over and over.  There are characters who the children can relate to and characters who the adults can relate to, like Professor Snape.  He is a very deep character who on the surface seems mean, but there's much more to him than that.  Alan Rickman plays Snape perfectly. How many people thought Snape was the evil one after the stone? Even I did at first, but I am rather proud of my deduction when I worked out it wasn't him. It's a pity there are no magical schools like Hogwarts!

It was expected that the actors who would eventually play the trio would have to be 'green' (unexperienced) because veteran child actors are often not right for franchise roles. So a new ensemble, a poor director, and a mediocre screenwriter. But it could still have come out good right?... WRONG! Chris Columbus' direction was absolutely appalling! His incoherent transitions, unchanging camera angles, lack of any use of dolly shots, over-use of tracking shots, monotonous lighting, and complete ignorance to inform his actors how to actually act, immediately contributed to the collapse of this picture. Kloves' writing didn't contribute any quality to the abysmal film either. The novel was an epic: written as an epic, described as an epic, and sold as an epic. So why was the script written like a quirky independent film? Furthermore the CGI in this film (despite Columbus' excuses of time restrictions) INEXCUSABLE! You do not have ghosts float in 2D patterns as though designed on Apple iMovie when you have a budget exceeds 100 Million dollars! Now: The Ensemble. Too many reviews have been published tearing apart the acting of the three actors portraying the most well known characters in history. So I won't... JUST KIDDING! The acting was and remains now, encased in DVD releases, some of the worst in cinema history. ""You mean? That thing was Voldemort?"" was meant to be spoken in a spine-chilling and dragged-out way that made the audience cringe in terrifying realization, and was instead spoken as though Harry Potter had stumbled upon a surprise party. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson deliver some of the MOST irritatingly bad lines ever spoken, it's rather easy to simply learn to not over-act, to not under-act, to just act! Espesially in a role so perfectly described in books. Rupert Grint was tolerable. The movie was an enormous insult to the well-written book of the same name and despite the hype surrounding the apparent attraction ten year old girls have to Daniel Radcliffe (whose normal weight does not fit the skinny persona described in the book) and the ""amazing"" (gag) special effect, most critics and fans alike cannot bare to even watch the film a first or for those unfortunate ones like myself a second time.

10 December 2001,Bobbyh-2,," Literal, long, slow, ponderous, inexplicable
","First of all, I've read the first two Potter books and found them pleasant and clever, but hardly brilliant. They certainly don't measure up to classics like the Narnia cycle, Tolkien's books, or Madeleine L'Engle's either (A Wrinkle in Time, for instance.) Though undoubtedly clever, much of the author's cleverness is of a literary nature, which made me skeptical about how it would fare as a film. My skepticism turns out to have been well-founded. The movie is certainly faithful to the book, perhaps too much so. It could have been pared by a half hour or so and been the better for it. Chris Columbus's overuse of close-up reaction shots--Harry grinning, Harry and his friends looking at something in pop-eyed awe, Harry grinning yet again--to drive home how a scene was supposed to make the viewer feel--drove me a little mad toward the end. Subtle, this director ain't. There is, to be sure, excellent work by some fine veteran actors, such as Richard Harris, John Hurt, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane. But, at the risk of being labeled a curmudgeon, I found the kids, though cute as buttons, were simply not up to their roles. Again, Columbus's constant closeups didn't serve the young actors well, and it may be regarded as unfair of me to expect kids to have the kind of inner resources to develop fully-fleshed performances. But they are expected to carry this film to a very large extent, and--well--they couldn't quite do so. There's also something a little repellent about the book and the film with respect to the portrayal of Muggles--non-initiates to the world of witchcraft--as being (at least implicitly) invariably stupid, crass, and cruel. I also question the propriety of equating obesity with meanness and greed---even worse in the book than the movie. Kids with a weight problem must have some difficulty dealing with this aspect of the world of Harry Potter. Well, my money has already gone into the record-breaking box office gross that this juggernaut is piling up. And that, after all, is the point. Maybe the next film in the series will be better; the young actors will be a year older and the second book is a little more substantial than the first. But I do wish they'd bring in a different director. Under the circumstances, there's not a hope of that. Bah, humbug.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

","The only regret I have about HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE is that I'm not ten years old anymore.  Alas, I'm double that age (still young, obviously!!), and only discovered the wonder of Harry Potter, Hogwarts and Quidditch eighteen months ago.  Of course, I've since purchased all four novels and two supplementaries (FANTASTIC CREATURES and QUIDDITCH), and have just seen the film, which opened five days ago here.  Yes, I suppose we had our own books and films when we were children (including FINDERS KEEPERS, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, BATMAN, THE WITCHES), but nothing which united (nearly) everyone, and appealed to parents and older children as much as HARRY POTTER.  The simplicity of the concept is, of course, the key: it's a fairly formulaic plot, with semi-predictable twists (of course, I'm speaking more from an adult point of view here) and the subject matter is something which will continue to fascinate children for generations to come - magic. The film is, in my opinion, the best possible outcome of attempting to adapt the novel: the Quidditch game is spot-on, the child actors are well-cast (even if they do try to overact in places, but one has to expect this), the magic of Hogwarts Castle and Hogwarts Express and the invisibility cloak is definitely there.  Some have accused it of dragging in the middle - I must say I was expecting this, being a part-Hollywood production and nearly 150 minutes long, but I never experienced it: I was obviously too preoccupied with the wonder and magic of it all.  I couldn't help thinking how I would have reacted to such a film ten years ago: I would have surely been in heaven.  The real magic of the story is, of course, Rowling's promotion of ""dorky"" behaviour, which has been victimised in the last fifteen years from Americanised ""satirical"" TV series (THE SIMPSONS, SOUTH PARK, etc...) and general irresponsibility by marketers aiming their products at children. For example, children as young as seven and eight are worrying about ""image"" - boys must have short spikey blonde-tipped hair like the boy-bands, and girls must dress like Brittney: they are being forced to grow up far too quickly, and are exposed to images etc which have detracted from traditional children's stories...until now.  Ten-year-olds don't listen to Peter Coombe anymore, because there's no such performer out there: youngsters still have The Wiggles, and Hi-Five is doing its best, but acts like Brittney Spears & Co. have broken into this (very lucrative) age bracket - kids must now act like teenagers, another culture which didn't exist pre-rock'n'roll.  But with texts like HARRY POTTER, MONSTERS INC, A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, etc..., kids can be kids again: it's becoming accepted once more.  Hell, HARRY POTTER promotes reading, playing chess, intelligence, initiative - and glasses (!!), five things which have certainly been ""outlawed"" in the past decade by THE SIMPSONS and SOUTH PARK-style shows.

4 May 2019,CinematicGarbage,6," A great Introduction to the Wizarding World!
","Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone (2001) is the first movie of the Harry Potter franchise, directed by Chris Columbus, who directed two first Home Alone movies. This is one of my favorite fantasy movies. There's so much things to see, a lot more than Lord of the Rings.
About the casts, Daniel Radcliffe was chosen to be Harry Potter, the boy who lived, Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. I really love these three characters and I also love it when they team up to discover something. I also like Alan Rickman being Severus Snape (one of my favorite characters). His voice was amazing and I couldn't describe it. And there's Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, one of they characters I hated the most. He's an a-hole, always messed up with Harry Potter and his friends with his dumb friends, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. I really hate Malfoy but I don't hate Felton bacause he acted well being one of our most hated characters. One of my favorite characters is Rubeus Hagrid, a lovable giant who always smile when he saw Harry Potter.
There's lots of magic in this movie. Everything is creative. And the most creative thing is Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It had a creative name (with a Hog). The creative things about Hogwarts is they there're four houses and your personality depends on one of them. Quidditch is a really creative sports. Being in a broomstick hitting and catching a Quaffle or using a bat and hit the Bludgers or maybe catching a Snitch is so much fun but also dangerous. The subjects like Herbology are also really creative. Everything in Hogwarts makes me wanted to be a wizard in there. It's such a great school. You can be far away from your parents just like Harry being away from those stupid Dudleys (they're worse than Malfoy). I also loved the CGI, they made everything looked like real magic or maybe a different dimension. The one problem is when they put their camera behind Harry Potter with a red sweater facing Professor Quirrel looked like a video game. I don't know how it happened but it was like a video game from my perspective.
The Original Score from John Williams is so iconic. It was perfect for the movie and everytime you come to a Harry Potter Wizarding World, you'll hear the score played and it will bring you to the place itself.
The Harry Potter Universe is my favorite world. There's creative magic and J.K Rowling is creative. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer Stone is one of the greatest movies that filled your childhood with dreams and joys. Though it's not my favorite of the franchise but the movie is the greatest introduction to this franchise.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

Drawing from fantasy literature and owing quite a debt to earlier writers such as Roald Dahl, J.K. Rowling made her stories about Harry the Wizard into a phenomenon. It's been a merchandising groundswell, a boon to children's literature, and a godsend to parents everywhere.  What could be better than having your child dive into a 300+ page book for hours on end?

Ginny, for example, in the whole of the movie, 150 minutes, says only two words, ""Good"" and ""luck"". I hope she takes a much bigger role in the next, as she is a big part. If she doesn't, that will be exceedingly unfair to Bonnie Wright. She definetly deserves it...and what about Rik Mayall? He was supposed to have been in the movie, as Peeves...but do we see him? No! And I WAS expecting a little more than a white bald head for Voldemort. He is a demon, not a little bald head. That, really is pathetic. The only reason this movie was halfway decent was that J.K.

24 July 2008,kalendra274,10," Magic, entertaining and quite similar to the book
","I've watched this movie a long time ago and I must say, it simply took my breath away. I've read the book and it was as terrific as the movie, it was quite similar to it but it skipped a few bits out such as the ""The Midnight Duel"" and the beginning. But I understand they wanted to make the movie shorter and enjoyable and I certainly have no problem with that. I thought the plot was excellent and it fits in with the book (it's a good thing that they didn't skip a chunk of bits out from the book and made the plot very different from the book - who wants that?) and I must say all the characters from the book was the perfect choice for all the characters in the movie, such as Dumbledore, he looked exactly like the person in the back cover, which of course was Dumbledore. So all the choices for the characters were all incredibly realistic and makes the audience picture them in the book. The performances from the wonderful cast were out-of-this-world! All of them played their role very well and realistically, including Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), and I believe it was his best movie yet! And the special effects used in the movie was, again, incredible! They were used at the right time, in the right place and they looked absolutely tremendous, in other words, REALISTIC! The castle looked incredibly amazing and all of the other settings/costumes etc. were one in a million. The beginning was good, but in my opinion, there should be a story-teller telling the people who haven't read the book what happened in the very beginning of it (introducing the Dursleys, what they do, something strange going on in town and even how Harry's parents died) so that could be an improvement, rather than just cutting to the action at once which makes the people who are not familiar with the book unsure. But they did some fantastic work after that, introducing Harry and how his miserable his life is with the Dursleys and it was very clever what happened in the zoo, making the snake talk to Harry, which that sort of unfolds the secret of him being a wizard so that was great as well. The Letters From Hogwarts were very clever too, but Harry's uncle kept on ripping them up, which makes the audience know that something weird is going on and I must say when the letters flooded the house, I was laughing my head off! And finally Hagrid came to the rescue right on Harry's 11th Birthday! Which makes the audience have a mixture of feelings, scared/wondering who it is at the start and relived that all the secrets his aunt and uncle kept from him is being told, including Harry's a wizard! At the pub everyones staring at Harry and shaking his hand, it makes you feel that you want to be be him too! And that an ordinary boy actually turned out to be a wizard and not get defeated by the the great wizard ""Voldemort"" (a dark wizard who killed Harry's parents but not managed to kill Harry) and also the name was very clever! When Harry met Professor Quirell, we got a completely different thought of him! He is a good guy, who is quite shy and stammers, but secretly he's a villain! Diagon Alley was amazing too, one of the greatest setting from the movie, which gives the thought of it's a place, where of course wizards go to but actually it's a normal alley, full of shops and people! And all the stuff in the shops, makes you want to have it such as owls and the Nimbus 2000! Gringotts was brilliant too, full of goblins doing work and while getting Harry's money, a secret jumps out, something is hidden in a vault but what could it be? Which makes the audience desperate to know the answer and they want to watch more and more, so that is a great way to keep them entertained. Discovering his wand was great, two wands that won't connect to Harry, but strange wand did! Amazing! The Journey To Hogwarts introduces more characters such as, Ron and Hermonie, and that is when their friendship is formed. Hogwarts Castle was remarkable, the makers tried so hard to make a real castle and they eventually did! Then we meet all the other characters and some are Harry enemies such as, Drace and Snape and then we find out Harry has been placed at Gryfindoor House, with all his other friends, so that is a great start to the year! And then we come to the mystery of the stone, which is truly captivating and grabs the audience and that is where the adventure begins and Harry faces new challenges such as Qudditch, fighting with a huge mountain troll and solving the mystery of the stone! So I strongly recommend you rent this movie on DVD/Video turn off the lights, grab the popcorn and get ready for two hours of pure fun and excitement!

The plot line of Harry's solving the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone (that's the REAL name of the thing--ask any alchemist) is emphasized to the detriment of the more subtle plot of Harry's struggle to achieve self-confidence and a feeling of belonging after his abusive upbringing with the Dursleys.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

The flying keys being rammed into the closed door was a shock for me--these little kids are messing about with rampant and powerful evil. The defenses around the stone were meant to be strong, and they were supposedly cast by ""good"" people, but they were intended very seriously to kill indiscriminately--how ""good"" is that? I felt that the explanation of Harry's survival as having ""skin covered with love"" fell a bit flat for me, and the physical abuse in the opening sequence was accompanied by Exorcist-type supernatural disturbances (I found myself almost feeling bad for the Dursleys, being attacked by all that mail! Almost--but not quite.) Perhaps if this film was aimed at the 16-26 demographic and was billed as a film with a dark edge to it, I would not have been surprised by the presence of darkness.

","Harry Potter was actually not bad; considering the director, I assumed it would be horrid as his other films.  It was a trace stodgy at the beginning, with much-too-much time spent with the awful relatives (this could have been a brief, effective montage during the credits--we know he's miserable, we don't need twenty minutes of beating over the head to ""get it"").  And we could have dispensed with the entire train ride; just because a scene is in a book, does not mean that it MUST be in the movie--movies and books are not the same medium, and a film needs to travel at some sort of a clip. But once Potter got to school, I rather enjoyed myself.  With the exception of the ghastly Emma Watson as Hermione (an awful, awful little actress who mistakes enunciation for acting), the performers are enjoyable and funny. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are always a delight, and they really set a pace in their scenes that the rest of the movie lacks.  Some of the effects are grand, some are rather lumpen, but the movie is by and large trying so hard to charm us that you have to give in or feel like a curmudgeon.  I gave in.  I had a diverting afternoon.  Oddly enough, I took my children (8 & 10) and enjoyed it MUCH MORE than they did.

Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K.

In the non-magic human world--the world of ""Muggles""--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, pig like cousin Dudley. A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: ""We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."" Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, ""I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!""

26 November 2001,theshape79,10," Great movie, but wheres Peeve's?
","I have to say this movie utterly left me flabbergasted. Not having read J. K. Rowlings immensly popular novels, and ignoring the jeers of my friends I went to see this movie with small expectations and returned a huge fan of Harry Potter. Where to begin with what the movie does right. First off is the casting of only British actors especially in the leading roles. To me thinking of some American actor stumbling around as Potter or Granger faking a British accent would have been just terrible. Thankfully Chris Columbus who seems to be the last person I would be praising after Nine Months, decided to steer off from that Hollywood movie machine idea. And speaking of the actors, they all do a wonderful job fleshing out the characters especially the young leads. Daniel Radcliffe finds just the right note making Harry Potter a character every audience member can envy and cheer at the same time time. Emma Watson plays the feisty Hermione Granger almost exactly as she is written in the book with that little bit of tartness I think most young girls have at that age( at least my sister does anyway.) Tom Felton hits just the right note of pure arrogance and prissyness as Draco Malfoy that you just want some to stand up and slap him during the movie. And Rupert Grint has fun delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie while also becoming equally as heroic as his two counterparts when the time calls for it. As for their older counterparts, they all play to greater range than would usually be called for in a movie of this type. Richard Harris is a standout as headmaster Albus Dumbeldore and Maggie Smith shines as Minerva McGonagle. Their not acting because their grandchildren are fans of the books, their in the movie because they believe in what they are performing. Another thing to note is Hogwarts itself. Everything is set to the screen amazingly intricate detail from the great hall to some of the classrooms themselves. Of special note, one of my favorite parts from the book is also one of the best set designs in recent memory, the huge wizard's chess board under Hogwarts. I also liked the fact that they didn't point out most of the special effects (i.e. ghosts, and moving pictures.) Some of these add too the visual flair of Hogwart's while enhancing the overall setting. When they do focus on special effects some are grand and exciting like the quidditch match (WOW) while others just fail to impress like Fluffy the three headed dog. Another thing, and this is very minor mind you is the exclusion of Peeves the poltergeist. As I found him to be one of the funner characters I wish they could have added him somewhere in the movie. Perhaps in one of the scenes involving Harry and his friends sneaking around the school at night while being followed by Mr. Filch the schools caretaker, he could have popped up. Maybe? Anyway thats just a small complaint to an otherwise terrific film. Sure its long, but trust me its well worth the price of the ticket. Take the kids, they might have as much fun as you will watching it.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

When he turns eleven he is picked up again by a giant wizard by the name of Hagred and taken to Hogwarts: The School For Witchcraft and Wizardry. When he finds out that the intruder eleven years ago is closer than he ever expected, he goes through many horror-filled adventures. A good film, with a cast that match the characters, and a story which is very good, and very scary.

","When I first heard of Harry Potter catching on, I believed it to be a fad and grouped it with Pokemon and that ilk of marketing genius. When, however, I stayed with an associate and could not sleep, I was handed the book and told to read it and see for myself. I did and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The film captures the book well enough and deserves a lot of the same merit. It seems like the actors were grown for the adaption of the book and they were very easily believable. This film may be family fare, but it is also a lot of fun to watch. Its plotline may not be Shakespeare, but its better than 90% of all thats out there and if you were at all excited about the pod race in Star Wars: A Phantom Menace, then the Quidditch scenes in this film are made for you. To be honest, this film did, for me, what Star Wars: A New Hope did and what I had hoped Star Wars: Phantom Menace could do, it made me believe in something fictional and applicable to my real life. To be honest, Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter aren't too far apart, both are the underdog, trapped children of circumstance beyond their control who achieve great deeds and still remain fresh faced and likeable. The reason Rowling's magic may be more likely to last in sequels than Lucas' did in prequels is because there is a certain heart in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone missing from Phantom Menace. Rowling did what Lucas once did, she makes us believe in the Power of the Heart and Columbus, through casting and great effects, captures what Rowling did with text in vibrant, sometimes over the edge cinematography and graphics that never become too much, but never leave much to be desired. Casting was flawless right down to the never fallible John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick. Once, Superman made us believe that a man could fly. Star Wars showed us the magic all around us. Now, Harry Potter shows us the magic within ourselves and lets our spirits fly. A true joy to watch and well worth a second or third look at least.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

Let's just face it: sometimes you just cannot make a film from books, especially great ones like Harry Potter. There are exceptions, e.g. The Lord of the Rings and Anne of Green Gables, but this didn't cut it. Draco Malfoy plays a prominent role in the book, and I have come to love him for it. But in here he is merely a background character, although the actor is very good. And there is a plot hole: Hagrid mentions that Snape protected the Stone. However, we do not encounter his enchantment, the potions. We only see Sprout's, Flitwick's, McGonagall's, and Quirrell's. From seeing a '1' on the spine of the Harry Potter video, I gather that there is an intent to make more Harry Potter films. If this film is anything to go by, don't see them.

The age old debate about viewing versus imagination is highly appropriate for this film.  Movie technology has become so good that nothing really astounds us any more, and since effects can no longer carry a film, it needs a good story or a fun story to do so.

Everything was depicted so well, even if things were left out of the book, but that's what the book is there for. The acting of everyone was so brilliant, and special. All the different characters in the big screen, shinning so brightly together like one big smile from beginning to end and every time you think about it. I am very pleased, very happy with this movie; and I was disappointed this movie did not get any awards. It deserves something. It deserves a lot more than that, but I don't know why people will always be so mean in judging towards things like this. 10/10 It's a very fun movie.

","As a great fan of the Harry Potter books, I was really looking forward to seeing the first Harry Potter movie. Well, I went to see it in the theaters a few weeks after it came out and I was not disappointed! It was very funny and true to the book. Most of the parts of the book were in the movie, and the parts that were left out did not hurt the movie at all. For anyone who has not read the book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is basically about a boy, Harry, who discovers that he is a famous wizard goes to ""Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"" and has to figure out who is trying to get at a secret package in the school. In the end, Harry comes to literally come face to face with the evil wizard that killed his parents and gave him a scar on the forehead.

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is a fun film to watch. I mean, magic tricks, big castle, interesting story. It started the whole legacy of the Harry Potter films, which we have all grown to love over the past 9 years. Wow, has it been that long? Anyway, even though the whole movie seems a little basic. Kid gets letters, kid learns he's a wizard, gets supplies for wizard school, kid goes to school, kid learns, kid learns about evil wizard, kills evil wizard, the end. I know it sound boring here, but I still think it's a overall good movie, which I think is just worth a rental, since you only really need to see it once. I've seen it a few times. I like to watch this movie occasionally. I also think the series could of ended here. I mean, I love all the other films, there great, but I think it didn't need to go on. Sure there all big secrets about Voldermeort but it still didn't need to go on. I'd definitely recommend his movie and the 6 others.

","Going into ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I did not share the current hype surrounding it. Two reasons: one, I did not read the book, and two, I was a little concerned about the man in charge of bringing the bestseller to the screen. Granted, director Chris Columbus knows how to work with kids, as evidenced in his megapopular ""Home Alone"", ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" I've enjoyed most of his work, even ""Bicentennial Man,"" which many did not. Of course, I hated ""Home Alone 2,"" as I felt it covered familiar territory in rather uninteresting ways. And even though I found his other films to be entertaining at least on a basic level, I also recognized how superficial his work is. Columbus lays on the sap and sentiments in ways that Hollywood loves and film historians loathe (see ""Stepmom"").",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2001,Janita Dusbee,9," Everything I didn't expect
","Like most people I was really worried about a number of things. First, of course, wether the movie would (or could) remain faithful to the book. This was not too bad. It was a pity for me that they didn't keep in all of the details, but I can understand this, because it would turn into a 5 or 6-hour movie if they would, and that, of course, is way too long. Second, I also had my doubts about the director, yet then again, his Home-Alone-films are great for children. Critics may dislike this kind of movie, but children don't, so why worry about that? Bu I would not like to see Harry Potter turn into a boy who starts crying his eyes out every three minutes. Fortunately, he didn't. Good for him. Third, the special effects. I have seen a lot of movies, with or without special effects, and from my point of view, they're rather disappointing. Therefor, I was absolutely satisfied with the effects of the troll and the quidditch-match. Fourth, the actors. I think nobody looks more like Harry Potter than Daniel Radcliffe. For a child actor, his acting is great. But my favorite is Rupert Grind as Ron Weasly. He is exactly like portrayed in the book. Emma Watson, who plays Hermione Granger, looks a but other than I had imagined after reading the book, but she acts exactly like J.K. Rowling described in her books. Alan Rickman, being one of my personal favorites, is the perfect embodyment of professor Snape (my favorite in the books!!!). It's a shame he doesn't get to show how mean he really is. Maggy Smith as professor McGonagal fits the part perfect, and this also goes for Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid. Overall, I think this movie will make it to my favorite-list. 9/10",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

The characters and their respective actors were excellently chosen, Alan Rickman as Snape was a really good choice in my opinion.  The only real problem i had with the movie as compared to the book was that in reading the book I got a much darker feeling so when the movie was so bright and cheery i found it a little odd, but other than that i think it was a great book/movie translation.  I'm sure that there are a number of Potter heads (hahaha) that will say thing were left out of the movie, but of course they were, there's no way to fit all the story line of the book into a movie and still have it short enough to hold the attention span of its target audience, as it was the movie seemed a little long for yournger Potter fans.

","I saw the film in summer 2002 on video, and have recently read through the entire series in less than a month. Upon reading the Philosopher's Stone, I learned how the film doesn't match up the this great book. Several characters are diminished or removed. The sorting hat sequence is shown to be much shorter as well. Yes, Susan and Draco's sorting is shown, but Lavender, Millicent and Neville are left out. Are there only five first years coming to Hogwarts this year? Are the others sorted privately? At the end of this sequence, Dumbledore's ""Few short words"" are sadly absent. Fred,George and Percy's parts are reduced and Bill is absent, leaving Norbert to be taken quietly and mysteriously during a scene change. Lee Jordan is cast much too young and basically becomes ""Quidditch Announcer boy,"" and his ad-libbed commentary is gone. Countless other changes are made to reduce time, yes, but rather sloppily. At times I could tell it was a Chris Columbus film. How about Harry and the gang screaming Kevin-style at the sight of Fluffy, or the lackluster job at adapting the British humor? As for the casting, most of it is well done, with some exceptions. Daniel Radcliffe is OK as Harry, but Rupert Grint's Ron isn't too great. Emma Watson is one of the prettiest child actresses I can think of, but therein lies the problem. I envision Hermione to be a bit of a weird cross between Asimov's Susan Calvin (plain, shy and book-smart) and Alexander's Elionwy (pretty, VERY talkative and oddly intelligent), having tiny bits of each. She's decent looking, but not as much as, say, Parvati or Lavender. She's a buck-tooth, remember. John Cleese's Nearly Headless Nick is poorly adapted, but he strangely receives top billing. All in all, it's better for those who have read the books. Prisoner of Azkaban is said to be a bit more accessible. I have yet to see this...

","I had never read any of the books before, and had only heard about them before I went to see this movie.  I wanted to see it because it looked very good, and the preview reminded me of one of my favorite Chris Columbus films Young Sherlock Holmes.  YSH captures the essence of old Britain with the same magical style as Harry Potter.  When I finally saw the movie, I was presently surprised at the brilliance and wit contributed by the writer, the director, and especially the actors.  It surprised me because I never thought a children's book could become such an involved and magical subject. The child actors seemed more like adults, but enhanced the genius of the film.  When you see child actors in movies such as Jake Lloyd, you watch them closely, as if they aren't as good as the other adults.  These actors were remarkable, especially the three main characters.  But I don't want to give these guys all the credit, let's not forget the excellent adult actors they have in the film.  Richard Harris was especially remarkable as the headmaster of Hogwart's.  Every time I saw him, I thought of a brilliant aged wizard, who knows all and has seen all.  I was also impressed with Alan Rickman's Severus Snape who was a great character and am hoping they continue his presence in the other films.  I have followed Rickman from different movies because I love his acting style, and he was perfect for this role.  Everything seemed to come to life in its own magical way. Kids filled the theater with laughter and surprises.  They were having so much fun with this, and I can only imagine how much better the movie might have been, had I read the book.  A film of this magnitude produces so much hype, it might have turned out to be another dude.  But I can say now that this movie is not just hype, it is entirely substance.  This movie could have been brilliant without the hype.  I completely forgot about the real world when I entered the world of Harry Potter.

13 August 2016,cathyemocling,9," Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is about a journey of a boy in exploring his true identity as being a wizard.
","(EAPP11_REV2016) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone is the very first book in the J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Its film or movie remake was released in November 2001 directed by Chris Columbus and produced by David Heyman. As you know, some call this film the Philosopher's Stone and some call it the Sorcerer's Stone. The explanation behind this is that the ""Philosopher's Stone"" is the British name and the ""Sorcerer's Stone"" is the American name. For those who haven't watch the movie yet, I'm going to give you a little glimpse. There was once a boy whose true identity was suppressed from him by the family who kept him for 11 years. When he turned 11, someone came to reveal his true identity which changed his life for the better. That boy is Harry Potter. He entered a school of Witchcraft and Wizardry named Hogwarts. Here he discovered a whole lot about himself and developed friends. This is where the all the magic began. If you would compare the book from the movie, there are some parts or chapters in the book that was not included in the film and there are some that were in the movie but not in the book. Nevertheless, the portrayal of the book in the movie was still great and those parts that weren't included in the movie did not affect the plot of the story unlike other movie remakes of other novels where they completely changed the plot line. If you want to know the chapters or parts that were not included in the movie, you may want to read the book first before watching it. The cinematography is quite amusing because knowing that it was released in 2001 where technology wasn't that advance as it is today. The graphics or visual effects were okay because it doesn't look like that it was fake or that edited. Of course, as the series go on with the other films, the effects were highly improved as technology evolved. The choice of music perfectly fits the movie because for me, classical music best fits the theme of magic and mystery. I can't imagine the film with songs or music that have lyrics or are of different genre. The choices of stars/artists were perfect where Daniel Radcliffe starred as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. They were really adorable in the movie because they still have that young charisma that's why it doesn't matter who or what age is the person that'll watch this because they'll feel that it is not old. I can't even imagine anyone who can portray the role of Harry Potter if it was not Daniel Radcliffe because even if he starred in other movies I'll always call him Harry. Harry Potter was released for a long time now yet more and more people, children and adults, are still very fond of it. Even if they weren't born in the earlier years of 2001, Potterheads will always come back to the very first episode of the Harry Potter Series. I, myself is a big fan of this. There are a whole lot of plot twists and mysteries that are shown in this movie as well as in the other movies of the series. I'm telling you, Harry Potter will take you to another world full of enchantments that'll make you believe in magic.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

Not only did he look exactly the way that I thought he would, he has very good acting skills for an 11-year old kid. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were also great. Rupert was so adorable and funny, and Emma's Hermione was just as I thought she would be-stuffy on the outside, but on the inside, a genuine and kind person. Professor McGonagall was amazing.

21 September 2008,Sterling52,8," A faithful adaptation
","I will always think fondly of this movie because it inspired me to pick up the first Harry Potter book and I've been a rabid fan ever since. I'm one of those book before movie people so I had to read the novel in order to go see this movie and I was pleased to see that it was such a faithful adaptation to Rowling's wonderful tale. This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the wonder and awe of the first HP novel. Hogwarts was an especially lovely effect and when Harry first walks into the Great Hall and all the candles are floating overhead, I felt all the magic I felt when reading those words on the page. I think Columbus and crew captured the essence of the castle and somehow managed to create a visual of something so fantastical. The casting of the movie was also extremely well done. I adore Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Richard Harris captures the mischievous and wise nature of Dumbledore. Perhaps best of all the adult casting is that of Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. He looks exactly as I pictured the character but, more importantly, he captures Hagrid's rather childlike nature and the accent is wonderful. Coltrane doesn't just portray Hagrid, he is Hagrid. I also thought the children were wonderfully cast. Daniel Radcliffe looks like Harry and I fought back tears when his earnest young face first looked into the Mirror of Erised. Rupert Grint looks just as I pictured Ron Weasley and Emma Watson is wonderfully bossy and a fantastic know-it-all as Hermione Granger. The casting of the Phelps brothers as the Weasley twins was absolutely brilliant and I think they were dead on in their interpretation of the lovable scoundrels. Yet in spite of its fantastical nature, this film, like the book, feels as though it is something like our own reality. There are many wonderful things in Harry's world but it's not that different from our own. The same prejudices and the same human frailties that exist in our world exist in Harry's. Though being a wizard is pretty darn cool, it's not the answer to Harry's problems and the film makes clear that he has some difficult challenges ahead of him. I think the central theme of this movie is one that is invaluable for both children and adults alike: that love is the most powerful magic that exists. Even with all the wand waving and fantastical creatures, it is love that is Harry's salvation.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

We can clearly see where the money has been well spent in transforming this parallel magical universe into something that George Lucas would put his name to. I was rather surprised by the relatively subdued reaction of the(mostly under 15) audience both during and at the end of the movie, with few fearful gasps or hoots of laughter that makes me wonder that my simliar behaviour was not so off the mark. I feel there is not very much in this film for most adults (or their inner children) especially when one compares it to brilliant efforts like the Toy Stories, Shrek and not to mention all the Simpsons episodes.

They may have picked him for his looks but not for his star power. They really blew the casting for Harry in my opinion. There were some very good scenes but even the showstopper Quidditch match and the chess match was rushed and boring.  The scene in the forest was very good but again short. The finale I enjoyed but for some reason I kept expecting Voldewort to tell Harry he was his father.....hmmm, Ive seen that somewhere before though. Anyway. This movie gets a 7 from me just because of the attempt, stunning although cold sets and a couple of decent performances from the adults. This franchise is destined to make Billions in hype alone.

4 June 2002,kurt120,," a worthy movie version
","Having not read any of the books, or previously seen the film at the cinema, the wonderous world of Harry Potter was a real revelation. For those that don't know Harry is an orphaned child destined, once removed from the horrible life forced on him by his aunt and uncle, to become a great wizard. But first he must get through Sorcery School. Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs Doubtfire) hasn't gone overboard with his scene setting, but has used his imagination to great effect, bringing beautifully to life the scenes at Hogwarts School. At various times Columbus has delved into Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, Willow, Star Wars and even the Indiana Jones series of films for inspiration. Young shooting star Daniel Radcliffe fits the persona of Harry perfectly and seems to have an understanding of the importance of getting his role right. If Harry weren't perfect, the film would've been a disappointment for the many fans of JK Rowling's adventure. Even his young sidekicks, the wonderfully expressive Rupert Grint, as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson (a young Britney Spears lookalike), as Hermione Granger, are great. The best performances are reserved for the adults, in particular Robbie Coltrane, who plays Hagrid, and veteran Richard Harris, who stars as the revered Albus Dumbledore, while Alan Rickman as Professor Snape is, as usual, the perfect villain. It's easy to get lost in the world of Hogwarts where stairs change direction at the drop of the hat, ghosts walk through the halls and trolls spell trouble. The movie was a little long and many scenes could have been cut, but to do so may have rendered some damage to the fabric of Rowling's rich tale. What Harry Potter is, is a magnificent children's tale that also enraptures older audiences, leaving them spellbound as the story washes over them. While there's nothing particularly new about the direction of the movie and it certainly isn't flawless, it will remain a classic - even if it is only because Harry Potter popularised reading among young people again.

5 November 2014,msloane1,8," A Magical Beginning
","I am huge fan of the Harry Potter series. On a 5 star scale I would give 6 of the 7 books in the series (all except Goblet) 5 stars. And when it comes to rating this movie, I would it give it a 10 if I were judging it based strictly on how much I enjoyed it. That said, I think on a 10 star scale the most accurate rating for the movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is 8. The movie is reasonably faithful to the book. And some of the decisions about how to transfer the story from book to film worked incredibly well. For example, the opening chapter of the book is a chapter of crucial importance. But this scene could not be allowed to drag on for 15-20 minutes in the film. A balance had to be struck between respecting the importance of this chapter and condensing it for time and space. The film struck this balance masterfully by eliminating Uncle Vernon's day and only showing Harry's arrival scene. Since that ""day"" was really more Uncle Vernon's story than Harry's it was able to be cut without doing any damage and what's left focuses on Harry's story as it should. Plus, cinematically, it worked well to have that whole opening scene set at night. This kind of good decision making was present throughout most of the book to movie transition. The only real flaw is that the main version of the film omits the scene where Harry finds Flammel on the back of the chocolate frog card before Hermione goes to retrieve the book. Hermione going to retrieve the book makes far more sense of the scene of Harry finding Flammel on the chocolate frog card before that is included. This is a deleted scene but it should have been in the main movie. Overall the book is reasonable faithful to the book. The casting is bloody brilliant. Robbie Coltraine and Alan Rickman were PERFECT for the roles of Hagrid and Snape. You can almost feel Hagrid's warmth through the screen when you watch this movie. As you expect, Richard Harris was a great Dumbledore, wonderfully capturing the grandfatherly mentor from the books. It's a shame he didn't live long enough to complete the series because he was so awesome in the role. Daniel and Emma do show some noviceness in this movie but their subsequent performances in the later films proved the casting correct. The special effects and visuals were mixed in this film and are by far the weakest in the series. On one hand, the filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing things like Qudditch, the Great Hall, and the Hogwarts Express to life. On the other hand some of the CGI was too cartoonish. Fluffy isn't scary at all and the troll is downright comical. The best part of the filmmaking was John Williams score. John Williams should have won the Academy Award for Best Original Score for this movie. This is some of the best music I've ever heard. And it's so identifiable. You here this and it instantly puts you in mind of Harry Potter. And the pacing is outstanding. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an engaging and engrossing movie from start to finish and has very few slow moments.

","I saw Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone last night with a friend of mine. It is the first time that I have seen a Harry Potter film. The movie is highly entertaining and enthralling. Richard Harris, as the old wizard, is the movie's Yoda and, in fact, there are many similarities between this movie and the original Star Wars trilogy. Spiritually superior kid Harry (Luke Skywalker) is sent to live with foster parents until he receives his calling to study wizardry (the force) and make his way as a powerhouse in the world (or galaxy.) The movie's weak spot is it's acting among the three main children. Harry is a super mature young person, scary for someone who's really just a kid and should be acting like one. His buddy, Weasely, is in the film as comic relief and no doubt received one acting command ""Look scared."" This he does often and well. The little girl (sorry don't remember her name and can't back arrow) is as cute as she can be but isn't a tremendously talented actress at this point in her young life. The backbone of the movie is it's delightful old guard. Maggie Smith, as delightful as ever, plays a witch/professor. Her presence and her voice are still absolute magic (important for a film about magic!) Robbie Coltrane is a great big teddy bear and he creeps into our hearts. John Cleese is a perfect casting move as Nearly Headless Nick, the almost headless ghost that hangs around the Hogwarts school. Alan Rickman is absolutely stone cold cool as the dark Professor Snape. He is so darn rigid that he talks almost without talking. There are tremendous little details in the movie, such as images in old paintings coming to life, that make the movie rich and absolute fun to look at. The plot is decent, although it's not very tight and there are reaches and lots of guesses (most of them correct) along the way when we think, ""How could they know that?"", etc. The movie is also delightfully (the last time I'll use the word delightful) English, told in a lighthearted and intellectual fashion. Fun entertainment, not for adults to watch more than once but new young viewers will (and have) eat it up.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

In the book, there is a specific moment when there are apologies all around among Ron, Hermione, & Harry and the boys become friends with her.  They failed to resolve Hagrid's dragon problem and made no mention of the properties of each house(except, Slytherin, of course--'all the great ones come from Slytherin!"").  Not to mention all the wands Harry went through before he finally found his, and the potions trial in the dungeon as they're getting the Sorceror's stone(proving logic has merit, too.  That scene would also explain Dumbledore's comment about Hermione remaining cool under pressure-it's a nice pun, as they have to pass through fire). But like I said, you can't include everything!

","First, as the title to this review indicates, I, unlike so many of the teeming masses that went to see this movie opening weekend, have not read the J.K. Rowling books so other than the tidbits I had picked up from my wife, I had no clue what to expect other than long lines. But my wife would have killed me if we hadn't gone. Well in fact, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I had a hundred questions for my wife about the books afterward and will likely now find some time to read the books so I can see how it compares. I found the world J.K. Rowling created to be quite charming and full of a life of its own. Hogwarts was nothing short of stunning in its concept and rendering. Kudos to the actors too...Alan Rickman was FANTASTIC (but then he usually is) and the child actors were well chosen and very likeable. Daniel Radcliffe was a tad shallow of emotion as Harry, but not nearly so much as I was lead to believe by the critics. In short, if you have any doubts, go see this movie.

The 17-year-old thought it was missing something and hoped that people would read the books before seeing the film.  Her creative vision differed from Columbus.  The 7-year-old was glued to the screen and didn't utter a word, the 44-year-old was enjoying watching the girls react and found it amusing.

","Having just walked out of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", this reviewer is still reeling from the experience.  Who would have thought Chris Columbus had another masterpiece left in him after ""Adventures in Babysitting""?  Columbus proves that his breakthrough was no fluke, and that he can indeed helm such a highly anticipated fantasy film without fail. Despite terrific performance from the fat guy in ""Naked Gun 2"" and Peter O'Toole's drunken sidekick, however, ""Potter"" feels somewhat incomplete. What it needed was a cameo from Michael Gross of ""Family Ties"".  Gross was born to play the janitor of the Hogwarts institute, but the lack of originality on Columbus's part prevented this from happening.  Instead, he relies on the talents of John Lennon in the title role (the bespeckled one hasn't acted in over thirty years, so Columbus's choice here is rather puzzling).  Nonetheless, a great effort by all involved.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2001,waitingforgodot-1,3," Long, pointless and boring!
","This film was way too long, especially for a children's film. The quality of acting was low, however only for the child actors. The cast included well-known names whom I felt could have done a lot better in other films. I was bored after the first hour and was waiting for the film to get onto a point...but it didn't come at all! However, considering my own choice in movies, which is completely different, others with me seemed to enjoy the movie from beginning to end as a magical experience filled with enchantment and adventure.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was not a perfect film, but is probably the BEST family movie ever and a very entertaining movie all around. ",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2003,shadowed_vandread,6," OK, didn't really like it.
","I read the 3 Harry Potter books(maybe 4th, don't remember which came first). After reading the first one, i thought, not bad, the 2nd one sucked, the 3rd was ok. When the movie came, i wasn't hyped about it like everyone was. After much persuasion I watched the movie before it closed in my country. The movie was under average, but not BAD, so i felt that I had kind of wasted 2 hrs or so there. There were many boring scenes, the ending was ok(was it? I forgot. LOL. Fine, not funny.). Daniel Radcliffe was not as good as I thought he would be, and Emma Watson(was it Emily?) sucked. The person playing Ron Weasley sucked too. Overall, it was an average movie to me, i don't understand how it grossed $968m, LOTR was so much better, the movie had a spectacular Quidditch fight, but after a while it got boring. I kinda felt like i wasted $8.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2010,gonzosintheair,9," The movie ""Troll"" had a character Harry Potter
","I believe credit should be given where it is deserved. If a person is inspired by someone else's imagination then he/she should own up to it. What are the odds that two separate people will follow the same genre and name the main character with the same first and last name. I don't know what those odds are but I'll bet they're pretty astronomical. The name Harry Potter was the original name of the hero boy in the movie ""Troll"" (1986). The story also involves a fantasy world with a witch, sorceress, wizard, troll forest nymph and magic. Harry even asked if he could be the sorceress's apprentice. Let's be fair, ""Troll"" was probably the inspiration for the Harry Potter books and movies. Because I respect my sister's judgment and she and her daughters speaks so highly of the Harry Potter stories, I'll give it a 9.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2005,wet_willie_89,8," Fantastic adaption of the book.
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic book and now a fantastic movie. It was pretty much what i expected though i wish at the start they showed more of the dursley's as i have a soft spot for them. The casting was great to Daniel was great as Harry, Ron pretty much matched Ron and Hermione was was pretty good to, and since i knew the movie was coming out i could see robbie coltrane as Hagrid and Richard Harris was stunning as dumble dore. The Movie was very faithful to the book and kept it all together thanks to columbus of course. And the visual effects were pretty good especially for fluffy the three headed dog and the ghosts and things but this was a fantastic movie...and i look forward to the second one.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2004,Claudia_loves_films,," A magical Adventure?
","I first saw this film when I was eleven I instantly fell in love with it. For me it was the most magical, exciting thing I had ever seen. I instantly felt as if magic was real. I had never read a single Harry Potter book before so the whole thing was totally new to me. But now I have watched it again it doesn't feel the same, I have grown up and the magic has gone. I think the actors they chose where okay. For an 11 year old ,I think Daniel Radcliffe did a superb job of being Harry Potter. I am not to keen on Chris Columbus and I'm glad that some one else is doing the Prisoner of Azkaban. I think the fact that the story was so close to the book was great, I love it when writers really take a good role in turning there books into movies. Even though J.K Rowling didn't write the script she has remained a big part in the making of the Harry Potter movies, which I think is an added bonus. I think the film is enjoyable for all ages but I think child under twelve will benefit the most from it, as the magic is much more real for them.",/review/rw1324742/?ref_=tt_urv
