","I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2001,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Actually it got better for me
","Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story.

","I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see.""

The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.

11 January 2015,CalRhys,," Haunting, Powerfully Resonant And Visually Stunning
","James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 1998,Rage-4,," bravo
","Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.

Almost all of my female friends of the time adored this movie and paid to see it multiple times in theaters, so I can see why it saw so much box office success. Also, there's no question that when the boat sinks, it's terrifyingly spectacular. However, the real downfall of this movie is the terribly corny dialogue. The script sounds like it was written by adolescents. Plus, the love story is overly melodramatic.

Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron.

I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2014,ironhorse_iv,8," If you haven't yet saw Titanic. Get onboard! Titanic is king of the world!
","When you talk about 1990's pop culture, it's really hard to not mention, the biggest blockbuster from that decade, Oscar Winner, Best Picture of 1997's Titanic. Directed, written, by James Cameron, the movie had everything that people wish to see in a movie, making it one of the biggest money makers of all time. The movie had plenty of action, history, romantic, and music to get everybody onboard. The movie gives a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 14, 1912. It tells the story of two members of different social classes, high socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and working class, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio) falling in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The movie was so popular, that a 3D version of the film was released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earning it more money. The 3D version was pretty good. Titanic spun a number of other successful things such as; musicals, soundtrack, hundreds of different types of merchandise, books about the Titanic, a video game about Titanic and countless rip-offs movies. I think a good reason why a lot of people went to see this movie is how simple the story is. Yes, it's a bit predictable and pretty recycled from old Hollywood style that previous Titanic type movies had, such as 1958's A Night to Remember & 1953's Titanic. You can really see it, if you look close enough. It's full of familiar tropes and clichés. Still, the movie concept really got update to epic scale with the expensive budget, well use, in the films visual, special effects, costume, sets, and other sides of the production. James Cameron really made the movie felt like it overlap a lot of genres. It was great historical romantic action movie with many subplots like a treasure finding mystery suspense, a horror lifetime movie melodrama about female abuse, a social commentary film about classism and social Darwinism, etc. etc. Indeed, the movie is mostly label as a love movie, and this is where some people might be turn off. People do love story, when there is something in stake. By putting their lives in stake, people want to see them overcome the dangers. People also love movie if the two actors playing a couple really do show on chemistry on film. Both Leo & Kate did well in their roles showing their charm, but their characters don't have much depth to them. We really don't see, much faults in them. Their characters are very simplistic people. Also, some of their dialogue made the love story seem unrealistic or too silly to be taken serious of. Some people might hate the song by Celine Dion, 'Heart will go on' but in my opinion, the song works so well. I do think, it does get a little bit overplayed. I also have to give mad props to James Horner's score. All of the music in the film does give the movie, its great epic romantic tone and later, it's intense edge. I had lots of fun, watching the Titanic lower class party. The music there, really fit the scene. The movie also has great cinematography, as it was all eye candy to me. You can't help going in front of any ship bow, and not think of that scene from this movie. Indeed, you're feel like you're flying. For a PG-13 movie, I was deeply surprise how erotic, it was. I was just a little kid, when it first came out, the movie was the first time; I noticed that women had pubic hair. I found the sex scenes and the nudity to be tasteful. Still, the whole love affair, really does undermine, the time wasted that could cover the real victims of the Titanic sinking, more. While the actors playing supporting historical characters were all great in their roles. They were also all one-dimensional props. I still felt emotional to them, when 'Nearer, My God, to Thee,' to the tune of Bethany was playing. It was hard not to feel something about the film. Another thing people might hate is the pacing. The movie is really long and seem slow at times. The movie is also a bit historical inaccurate, but the movie went into great details to make the movie seem like the Titanic, you see here is the real Titanic. Buy the DVD as there are a lot of great special features like delete scenes, commentary, and behind the screens. The 2012 DVD version also clean up some of the big mistakes.

","This movie truly broke my heart. Jack and Rose face great difficulties (her being an aristocrat and him poor) but they still continue to fight fo their love no matter what. We first see an old lady which we later on know is Rose. She sees on the TV the drawing of her that Jack had made when thenews was talking about the Titanic shipwreck. She then goes on to call the news and tell her story.84 years ago on April 10th 1912, 17 year old Rose is on board on the Titanic ship along with her mom, grandma, and fiance, Caledon, (all of who'm were nobelty/aristocrats). Rose feels helpessly trapped by her situation ( marrying her snobby fiancé, Caledon) and tries to commit suicide by hanging off the edge of the deck until she was rescued by Jack. Jack is then invited by Caledon to a dinner amongst the rich in return for his heroic action. He goes through the evening acting his best at being rich. Jack then takes Rose down to the third-classe's party, where they dance endlessly. Shockingly, one of CaLedon's spies had followed them and informed him of his fiance's sneaking around. Rose was intruiged by Jack's drawings and so she asks him to draw her nude wearing the diamond necklace Caledon gave her. Caledon finds out and had plotted against Jack, he falsely accussed him of theft and had him locked away. Not long after, the ship encounters an iceberg which threatens to wreck it apart. Panic overflows the ship as the crew/staff takes safety precautions, giving people life vests. Soon, the lower parts of the ship begin to drown. Jack is in danger and so Rose is in panic to rescue him from the room in which he is in chains in. She manages to get an axe and breaks the chains. The water was almost head-level. They both swim upwards and get to the top of the ship. Boats were getting filled up, women and children going first. Caledon ushers Rose to go in, promising her that Jack was going to be safe. She doesn't believe him and returns back for Jack. Caledon, furious, chases after Jack and Rose with a gun in his hand. Fortunately all his shots miss and they manage to escape to the top of the ship. Caledon soon fakes having a child in order to board a boat. At this point, the Titanic's end was titing upwards at an extreme angles, people were falling off whilst others were lucky enough to clang onto stuff. Jack and Rose hold on to the top of the ship and get ready to dive into the deep, freezing water. Fortunately, Rose;s life vest allowed her to swim a bit more easily, can not say the same for Jck though. Rose clings onto a wooden boards whilst Jack is barely holds on to it. They pass out and by the time help comes, it was way too late... Jack had frozen to death. Unknowing of that fact, Rose tries to shake him awake until she comes into the shocking realization. Jack drops t the deep ocean, his corpse becoming a part of the ocean. She is then rescued by the crew and taken back.

","Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man.

22 March 2019,nirome,10," Timeless and epic masterpiece
","On a purely technical level, Titanic was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker who's always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next. Up until that point and still to this day, he's managed to do just that. He's always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jaw-dropping, mesmerizing visual spectacle. Even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew, due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off- the- boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for The Terminator, like it was the case in Aliens, he's always managed to deliver. It sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one, but everytime he does, he hits the box office's bullseye.
This time around and, with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen, he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90s.
From the very first shot of the movie, those sepia color-corrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss, to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship, we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the Titanic. And we go back to the plot. As I said before, using the simplest of plot devices, a , on the other hand, very well told love story with tinges of social clashing, we are treated to a 3 hour, eye - catching spectacle that moves along at a whip-like pace. With very strong performances all throughout, gorgeous cinematography and production design, state-of-the-art visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late James Horner, this is probably one of Cameron's best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages. Needless to say, the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act, with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem. That, as always, and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by Cameron, is the main reason to watch this movie, and why the audience is so invested in what's happening onscreen. As I said, great movie and larger-than-life characters to go with it.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it.

","There are two love stories in this film: the first Romeo and Juliet and the second James Cameron and the ship.

The holes for each rivet in the hull of the 1/20th model were drilled by hand and actors who actually resembled the 1st Class passengers aboard ate and drank using teacups and cutlery stamped with the White Star Line emblem. The production is a seamless mix of miniatures, practical effects, CGI and actual footage from the wreck site and also genius in terms of saving money if you investigate further. There's nothing wrong with Leonardo DiCaprio's performance but Kate Winslet shines and, combined with the backstory of the search for the necklace, Titanic as a whole is an entertaining and respectful blend of fact and fiction, very well paced and doesn't feel like a 3 hour film. I'm a Titanic buff, so biased - the final few minutes of the ship tearing in two with hundreds of people still clinging to the stern makes me wince every time - but James Cameron's version of the disaster genuinely ticks every box.

","I wasn't really looking forward to this film, its a 3 hour romance movie and I am not a big fan of romance, but I gave this a chance and I have to say this is genuinely one of the best films I've ever seen. The movie manages to focus on a relationship between 2 different classes while also keeping it interesting with mystery, an intensity of what might happen, dread for the inevitable ending and also make many other characters interesting in there own right. The romance is done in a very realistic way and because of all the reasons I mentioned, the naturalistic acting of the actors and just how fun most of the characters are to watch on screen the movie really works. They also show the present and while I personally think that's the weakest part of the movie it does supply some interesting plot points and make the film more enjoyable overall as you're not constantly stuck in the past, the ending is also given a much more satisfying conclusion due to the present time scenes. Finally the 3rd act of the movie where the ship comes to its end is done in a brutal way showing just how much ruffles death it caused, how desperate the people where and how sad it was. The movie doesn't pull a punch and due to its long run time you almost feel like you know what it'd be like and almost like you yourself where there.

20 December 2022,GusherPop,10," 25 years Later its still the only movie to win 11 oscars and be the number one watched, loved and remembered movie of all time
","In the opening sequence of Titanic, a group of treasure hunters send a robotic probe far beneath the ocean's surface in search of treasures (and one particularly precious jewel) still tucked aboard the titular sunken ship. The camera attached to the probe reveals a vessel that's certainly rotted but still carries hints of its prior glory. The explorers coo and sigh as they see what's been waiting a century for them, as if they're looking at their dreams made manifest. This is the day they've fantasized about, and the treasures of people who once lived and loved aboard the RMS Titanic are their bounty. When the film was released, it was a gamble the size of ... well, the metaphors present themselves a bit too easily. It was a wild risk, both for filmmaker James Cameron (who was known for Aliens and his Terminator movies) and for the studios that funded it, Paramount and 20th Century Fox. Cameron's terrible temper and a runaway production with troubles to spare - one disgruntled crew member laced the chowder at craft services with PCP one night, provoking hallucinations in 50 people, including cast member Bill Paxton - had prompted people to wonder if the legendarily expensive film was doomed for the same fate as its subject. The production budget reportedly ran over $200 million, an enormous sum by any contemporary standards that was much more so in 1997. Titanic remained No. 1 at the North American box office for 15 weeks in a row. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and won 11 of them, including Best Picture. The movie continued playing in theaters for nearly an entire year, and didn't close until October 1, 1998, after earning $600 million in North America and twice that worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until 2010, when Cameron's Avatar wrested away the title. Titanic is two movies stitched together: a swoony teenage fantasy for the ages, and a massive disaster movie that rivals any disaster movie to come out of Hollywood either before or since. The lengthy runtime makes perfect sense by this rubric, and you can see the seam where the movie pivots from one to the other, almost exactly at the halfway mark. That Titanic is two movies in one is part of its genius: If it were just the romance, it might have been written off as a ""movie for girls,"" but then there's this whole other disaster element too. From a marketing perspective, that's gold.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","The movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the States. The movie made it big globally, had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of Academy Awards. The question, however, is – was this movie really that good? In my opinion, Titanic, while not intrinsically bad, is an overrated cinematic venture. For a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter, not exemplary . There was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie. Mr. Cameron, the director of the movie, is known for his sci-fi ventures, while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment. Strangely, the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel, which diverted attention from the focal event- the shipwreck. The director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted. Cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy, and requires a careful treatment of subject matter. Though undoubtedly a visual stunner, replete with amazing special effects, something the director excels in, the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization. Titanic suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

It goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release, but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing. People began to tire of hearing about what the stars (especially the new heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio) were doing, and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about ""Titanic."" The film had the odds against it: it's a romance, and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity.

Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie.

","James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron.

","Imagine being the Captain of The Titanic and told by it's architect that it will sink with absolute mathematical certainty. Immediate denial sets in but the instincts are too strong. The most incredible machine ever built by human hands will lie on the bottom of the ocean floor in a matter of hours, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

7 December 2019,TheRothOfKhan,10," Incredible Movie Making
","An absolutely spellbinding film that still holds up over 20 years later. I first saw this as a 12-year-old in 1997 and recall being utterly captivated by the story, the imagery, the characters, the score and the sheer spectacle of it all. 'Titanic' was an event, not just a film. There was nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since.
Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both relatively unknown actors at the time of the film's original release, shine as Jack and Rose, two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum who are brought together by fate against the backdrop of one of history's greatest tragedies. Winslet steals every scene with her portrayal of a deeply unhappy woman thrust into an engagement of convenience at the behest of her domineering mother, only finding happiness and her true self when she crosses paths with di Caprio's Jack Dawson. Tragedy inevitably strikes however, and it becomes a fight for survival as the great ship Titanic founders. For all of the special effects, it is the chemistry between Winslet and di Caprio that drives the film. If you have ever become infatuated with someone in a very short space of time, then it is very easy to relate to the relationship between Jack and Rose. They perfectly capture the intensity of infatuation and the recklessness of youth. Other excellent characters include Billy Zane's charming but abrasive Cal Hockley, Frances Fisher's sneering Ruth Dewitt Bukater and Kathy Bates' bolshy Molly Brown. Finally, the great Gloria Stewart portrays 'old' Rose with such sincerity and heart that it is difficult to believe she didn't live through all of this in real life.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","Remember the world's most heartbreaking moment, the sinking of the Titanic? Well, memories come back to us when the incredible James Cameron and his big imagination create a powerful love story disaster. The film is a fictional love story, taking place in a historical event. Set to the sinking of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a poor man named Jack, who falls in love with a rich woman named Rose, portrayed by Kate Winslet. Although separated by the number of money in their pockets, that does not stop the love between each other. Then, when Titanic begins to sink, sacrifices are being made, and Jack would do anything in his power to make Rose safe. James Cameron let out his heart into this movie, and really wanted to express his feelings on the sinking. Though the film is sad, and maybe too graphic, the film was a beautiful masterpiece portrayed by an amazing cast, a great direction, an amazing re-creation of history, brilliant costumes, breathtaking art direction, scene-stealing sound effects, visionary film editing, and exhilarating visual effects. I watch the movie over and over again and never got tired of enjoying it, cause it will never leave your heart. I'll never forget watching this movie, and I'll respect that it won the Best Picture on my birth year, and glad it made a billion dollars in the box office. This movie will always be epic and romantic in every way. This is a visual marvel, but it also has great characters and a terrific story to go along with it.

","Titanic is pop culture perfection. It's everything wide audiences crave and has elite craft. Even the writing (its weakest aspect) is fair. The love story is generic, but it's efficient and accents the dramatic disaster. In some ways, that romance is just right because the setting is already complex. More nuance could've overly complicated the film. Sometimes, simplicity is not only desired by audiences, but also required by circumstances. Meanwhile, the acting is quality. Leo is fine, Winslet is great, and the supporting cast is strong. All together, this provides the ideal amount of emotional investment to synergize with Titanic's grand spectacle.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw a dismal film ahead, when I first saw the opening credits, but it was still entertaining, and a little tragic.  In the typical James Cameron style, this film is just crawling with stuff you wouldn't believe.  The movie starts out dull, with Gloria Stuart helping to pad out the first ten minutes, but then it really gets rolling!  Afterwards, I had to ask myself: Hey, got a cigarette?  I felt spent, and that's typical of Cameron movies too.  If Cameron made a biblical film, I bet he'd have a twenty minute crucifixion scene.  The sinking was incredible, and they saved the best for last; the rest is just another day on board a Loveboat style rip-off.  Oh well, Cameron's not much without his special effects here, but that's what everyone who goes to see this movie already knows.  James Cameron should stop giving himself Orson Welles injections, and just stick to making action movies.  I just keep thinking of those slick effects in his other films, and how beautiful they all were.  This movie?  I guess James was just trying to display some emotion, but it was corny.  The sinking is what this movie's about. Rating: 7/10 (Bill Paxton must have been depressed about his part in the movie)",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","I liked ""Titanic"". Its a good old fashioned adventure/romance/epic with a strong storyline and definable characters. Sure the tacked on romance is as stock as the characters, but that is still better than the alternative served up by most modern movies: ie--no plot and no characterization at all. The thing that bothers me about this version of the Titanic sinking is that writer/director Cameron takes full credit for the screenplay, when so much of it was directly lifted from a 1958 film about the event, ""A Night to Remember"" (also a book, and a previous film). And I'm not talking about the fact the Titanic sunk, or any of the other factual details of the story--obviously those will be the same. I'm talking about virtually identical scenes, events, and dialogue that could not be gathered from public record. Scenes such as the ship's builder standing alone in the tilted ballroom, looking at the painting on the wall as the ship goes down. Or the rich ship corporation a**hole being told that yes, his ship is going to sink, no matter what he says. Or identical scenes of the steerage rabble breaking through the gates. These scenes, and many others, are mounted and shot in so similar a fashion to the previous film, with such similar dialog, that I believe they cross the border into plagerism.

(her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship.

It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here.

I mean, it is not, contrary to popular opinion, the worst movie ever made (although, yes, it may be the most overhyped, although The Matrix and Star Wars: Episode 1 are huge contenders). It is merely bad. There are very few things to like in this film. Technically, it succeeds to a point. I really did believe that I was watching a real ship sink (well, since the model built by Cameron for the film was just barely a model and more a full-sized ship, it ought to look real!). Some of the CGI was terrible, though. The people falling from the boat were so obviously digitally created that I laughed a bit. The writing is extraordinarily weak. Dialogue is just as bad. Everything that happened in the film, which takes over 3 hours, can easily be related on a cocktail napkin. The worst part about it has to be the acting. Kate Winslet has actually been good, elsewhere, but here she has nothing to work with. DiCaprio is bad. There's no saving him - his career, much like that of a boy band, is going down the toilet as I type (he's starting to gain weight and get greasy like Marlon Brando did - this sort of right is only reserved for actors of Brando's status, so stop it now, Leo!).

","This film is so full of absurdities and clichés that it is to all the previous Titanic films what ""Airplane"" is to the ""Airport"" saga and ""Blazing Saddles"" is to the Western genre. The unhappy high society girl goes down to third-class deck although it is out of bounds for her. She wants to jump overboard, but she is stopped by a happy-go-lucky nobody with no future and with nothing to his name but the clothes he is wearing on. As a reward he is invited by Hockley to dine fist-class with the jet-set so they can make fun of his lack of education and manners. But he gets along without making too much of a fool of himself, and charms everyone around the table but stiff Hockley and Rose's toff horrid mother. But bored to death from so many starched collars, small talk and no being able to scratch his bum,belch or pick his nose, Jack eventually sneaks away with Rose to a merry party down in third-class where one can swear, spit, get plastered on cheap beer, belch, fart and throw up until they fall flat on their faces. The next day a self-confident and jolly Jack enters the out-of-bounds territory of first class again looking for Rose, greets Mr Andrews like and old mate and trots along without being bothered at all. Although he sticks out like a sore thumb no one seems to notice him. Feel yourself at home, laddie, just don't take a leak in the flower vases, that's all. He is only stopped when he tries to disrupt a solemn religious service. That is the only one thing that cannot be tolerated by any means. Randy Rose asks Jack to draw her naked, and he does so while maintaining his coolness and concentrating seriously on his work as she lies there displaying all her jewels. But instead of banging her in the luxurious comfort of her private chamber they go down to the hull???... Meanwhile Hockley the Wally finally realises that his girl is bending over for that miserable third-class gutter rat, and boy, that drives him bananas. Then the ship bumps into an iceberg because the two idiotic sailors on watch duty are far more interested on the antics of the two horny kids rather than on doing the job they are being paid for in the first place. Here we go then: the unsinkable Titanic commences to sink and the movie finally takes off after 90 minutes of utter boredom. Mr Andrews rushes to the officers' room to deliver his diagnosis, and now there comes the most hilarious scene in the film. As Andrews states that the ship is already dead, company president Ismail almost has an apoplexy. You see his face, with his eyes almost popping out, his choking cry of ""But that is impossible! This ship cannot sink!!"" He is babbling in disbelief, his blood pressure rocketing up to the verge of a coronary, spit flying out of his mouth And Andrews turns to him -you can almost see his eyes rolling ""I built her, sir. She's made of iron. It can sink, and I assure you it will"" And that shuts Ismail up for good. So, now they've got just two hours to get out of there. First-class people go first, of course, since they are the ones who paid more for being here in the first place. Second-class will go after if still there is time. As to third-class well, we just learn now that the lifeboats have a full capacity for only half of the people on board, 700 of which are third-class rubble. Well, officers, you know the procedures: women and children first, and no paupers jumping the queue or you'll be fired. And then, if there is still time and a few empty places left, well just chuck a few ragamuffins into the boats and then save yourselves. And good luck. A third-class ticket for the Titanic did cost the equivalent to 1,500 euros in today's money, and a first-class cost 115,000. So you were treated accordingly to what you paid for, as simple as that. Although time is running out Hockley keeps his hair on, confident that he will buy his way out with a thick wad of notes in the last minute, but meanwhile he is about to play his last villainy: accusing poor old Jack of stealing the mother of all diamonds, and to do that he relies on the faithful assistance of his devoted butler. Nasty Lovejoy frames Jack and has him handcuffed deep below so that he will drown quicker. But stubborn Rose, in an almost superhuman feat that will have feminist radicals raving, sets him free, they get back to deck and try to board a boat. The outraged Hockley, now on the verge of an apoplexy,chases them with a gun in a comical sequence that culminates with another ridiculous line ""I put the diamond in the coat and I put the coat on her!"" The ship finally sinks into history, but the pair of randy doves manage to stay afloat. Now, the water is freezing and no one can survive in it for more than half an hour at the most. Yet Jack seems to last for hours long after everyone else floating around have succumbed to hypothermia. But eventually he dies too, because the story was meant to be a tearjerker in the first place. Miraculously enough, Rose, despite wearing her soaking clothes on all night, survives without even getting a cough (!!!)",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","Leonardo is a great actor. In THIS BOY'S LIFE (his best role), he plays a troubled youth with an abusive stepfather. In THE BASKETBALL DIARIES (his 2nd best role), he plays a troubled youth with a heroine abuse problem. In ROMEO & JULIET (his 3rd best role), he plays a troubled youth with a love problem. In TITANIC (his 6th best role), he plays a troubled youth with a sinking boat problem. In the 4 years between BOY'S LIFE and TITANIC, you'd think Leo would be able to master the whole troubled youth role (which he also played, and better, in Marvin's room). But it's still at the same level: energetic yet empty; loose yet fragmented; forceful yet tentative. The script doesn't help, though. In a word, it's awful. Kate Winslet towers over Leo here, and seeing her naked was a lot more rewarding experience than it is seeing her bare it all in HOLY SMOKE. Kate and Leo, however, make a good team, and they make it seem like they really love eachother. Though their tacky lines are an obstacle to cross. This could have been a great film.

","One of the well-known ships that became an disaster at sea was the Titanic. It sank in 1912 on its voyage out to sea. Disaster struck when the ship hits an iceberg and cause it to sink. The passengers of the Titanic were trying to survive. Many of them died. Some of them were in lifeboats. Now, James Cameron brings back the mighty ship. In his film Titanic, a man named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He goes on the Titanic after winning an poker game. Also on board an beautiful passenger, played by Kate Winslet and her fiancé, played by Billy Zane. DiCaprio and Winslet fall for each other in love as the Titanic ventures out to sea. Then, the iceberg hits the Titanic and that is when chaos begins. Passengers are frightened as the ship slowly starts to sink. The ship's sinking isn't about the passengers screaming and panicking, but it gives an realistic dramatization of the ship. Real documentary footage of the real Titanic appear on the opening credits. Winslet's character Rose, now old, is played by Gloria Stuart, who remembered what happen that night. The movie's visionary of the Titanic sinking is wonderful made with the special effects. As for Winslet and DiCaprio, they have great performances as Rose and Jack. The film itself is a tragedy of what happened. Titanic is one of the best films of 1997.

15 September 1999,Tommy-92,7," Has its flaws, but in my opinion was pretty good
","Yes, it was wildly over-rated, in that respect serving only to inflate Jim cameron's ego.  Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made.  Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn't really too wonderful.  Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I've ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning.  I didn't understand Billy Zane's character, but he wasn't on very much, so I didn't have to be confused by him a lot.  I do think it's awful that all those girls cried only over ""Leo"" and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion.  The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects. Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it. While the acting isn't spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances.  Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she's given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else.  Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well.  Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good.  Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there's enough there to really affect you.  Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene.  And just tell me you weren't in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on.  I mean, come on! This really happened!  It was the most affecting part of the movie for me. I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under.  All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn't up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there.  Perhas if people just didn't look at the first part and only at the second part, they'd understand one reason why this movie was so successful. Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again.  Maybe it doesn't deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says.  Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  There's more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","Are there lesser films in execution and entertainment? Of course. But I felt a ""One"" vote was deserved here for the overratedness of this movie by box-office and awards. I think the Oscars should be embarrassed this won all those Oscars, including Best Picture. As another commenter pointed out, it is funny that such a bloated film won ""Best Editing"". Honestly, this winning Best Picture would be like ""Ghost"" winning that award: a popular, sappy movie with pretty leads.. Only this lacks the actually humorous Whoopi...The ""romance"" is laughable. I like Winslet. She has at least tried to steer clear of this type of stuff since. Actually, mostly, so has DeCrapio...Malcolm X and Gandhi's lives: those are worthy of three hours(plus) of film..NOT this ""eternal romance""..Some people are simply impressed by the sinking. I'm sorry, but if there isn't one person on the ship I care about, the sinking does not mean much to me. Spectacle? Try nature. Go watch a volcano...BTW, I will say I think it is hilarious that people refer to Winslet as a ""cow"" in this because she isn't an anorexic actress. I honestly initially was perplexed whom they were even referring to, because Bates isn't even all that fat. Like they wouldn't want Kate as their girlfriend? Come on...I would certainly never want to see this one again...The script fails to portray an ""eternal love"". Rather it gives us a bit of lust. While it is believable Winslet doesn't want to be permanently with Zane, why she has to be with Leo is not shown...I t is encouraging that this is not in the IMDb Top 250...Perhaps the worst film to ever win Best Picture.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic (1997): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton: It became the biggest box office hit at the time indicating an event in history that plays off an interesting premise. A drawing of a woman is discovered within the ruins of the Titanic and after news coverage she appears at one hundred years old to bring reality to the historical tragedy. Director James Cameron showcases exquisite production and art direction at its most seamless and breathtaking just as he did with other big budget hits such as The Terminator and Aliens. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a drifter who steers Kate Winslet away from a potential suicide. She is caught within an arranged engagement where she grows increasingly sick of the lifestyle. They fall in love where he ultimately demonstrates sacrifice while she grows stronger. Predictably her family disapproves of him until they cling to each other during the pointlessly long climax sinking of the ship. DiCaprio and Winslet are basically Romeo and Juliet under different names. Billy Zane is embarrassing as her jealous fiancé who scowls and pursues them with a gun. Kathy Bates makes an appearance as one of the many doomed passengers. Huge achievement for Cameron but the sinking climax is overlong and sometimes corny as bodies hurl to their deaths leaving many hoping they will not sink with it.

","I must admit, as a movie buff, that this was the worst piece of sap-o-rama ever the ""grace"" the screen. I mean, What was the point?  It was about two little spoiled kids running around on some stupid boat saying stuff like ""I'll never let go"". Come on!!  The romantic side of it was so contrived it felt like I was being choked as I watched it.  None of the characters were even half-way decent, and all the actors were just a waste (Leo Dicaprio is a loser) the boat was the main character, and the iceberg was the supporting actor/bad guy.  Towards the end of the movie, I was hoping the boat would just sink already just to put me out of my misery.  When Kate Winslet was threatening to throw herself overboard, I was on the edge of my seat yelling ""Jump! Do it, Jump!""  James Cameron uses the death of a thousand innocent people in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience, since the characters of the movie can't do it.  The only redeeming quality of the whole film was Kathy Bates, but even she couldn't save this boat from sinking.  Let's face it, the only reason there is to watch this movie is if you got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist can't give you a root canal just right now, but you want to prepare yourself for the pain.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

Once you've seen the film the first time, it's opening scene and music immediately drives you to tears and they don't really stop for the next 3 hours and 14 minutes. As clichéd as the story of jack and Rose may be, a name had to be given to the faces that we lost in this preventable tragedy. And what a powerful love story it is. To have loved so deeply and passionately in such short a time and have it stay with you forever is what everyone wishes for themselves. A lot of flack is given to Cameron's script, and while it could be have been better, it certainly wasn't laughable. Winslet and DiCaprio gave incredible performances with what they were given and this film will truly stand the test of time, due to its powerful gritty nature. It was almost better back in the day when it was split up into two tapes and I would never put the 2nd one in because it was too heartbreaking to sit through. This film is truly a masterpiece.

23 May 2000,Covey-3,," Oi, Cameron. No.
","The problem director and writer James Cameron faces with a story about the Titanic is that the majority of his audience will know what happens. So to make his audience care, he switches the action and main plot from the ship, to a socially inappropriate love story between Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater. The trouble is that by incorporating the love story theme into the story, he seems to detract from the feel and humanity that previous Titanic films like A Night to Remember have had. Cameron instead opts for two separate halves to the story rather than melding the two separate elements together. The first half concentrating on building an audience rapour with the two main characters, while the second half concentrates on the special effects fuelled sinking of the doomed liner. This would be forgivable if it weren't for several key factors from the first half, the main weakness being the utterly one dimensional lead characters we are presented with. From Caledon Hockleys loveless millionaire to Rose's trapped innocence to Jack Dawson's poor boy with a dream. Aswell played as these characters are, the performance can't make up for the poorly written characters the actors have been given. Again, with the spectacle of the story of the titanic and the millions of dollars at Cameron's disposal, one could forgive the weakness of the characters, but then the  first half of the story is so entirely cliché ridden and full of predictability that it becomes obvious. It is clear that she will leave her safe life and existence and go with the unpredictability of true love. It is almost as though Cameron knows how to tell this story visually, he's just not sure or not capable of making you care about it. Cameron's writing has always come under scrutiny. The comic book quality of films like True Lies and the Terminator films set the scene for his writing style. The childlike quality of some of the dialogue shouldn't but does stand out. ""Something Picasso"" and Freud, is he a passenger?"" are so dire that they belong in a Farrelly Brothers film, not a $200 million blockbuster. Cameron does seem to be writing from the heart, the trouble is that his heart doesn't seem up to the task. ""It's pay-day boys"" and Dicaprio's now legendary ""I'm the king of the world"" seem not to be spoken by the characters in the film, but by Cameron himself. He is the master film-maker who can resurrect the Titanic and will make a fortune from it.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

It blends fact and fiction so well in a way that you rarely ever see on film. Movies like this are very easy to make, but there's very hard to make well and almost impossible to make great. It is also probably the most emotional moving film I've ever seen. It's the only movie that made me genuinely cry.

","TITANIC (1997) **** Leonardo Di Caprio, Kate Winslet, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, Suzi Amis, Frances Fisher, Victor Garber, David Warner. The most expensive film ever made and worth every penny (some $200 million!) that now ranks the international blockbuster box office champ in cinema history ($600 million plus!!) : filmmaker James Cameron's labor of love and exquisite depiction and detail obsession pays off in a monumental way in his fictional account of the infamous/tragic maiden (and doomed, final) voyage of the S.S. Titanic focusing on star-crossed lovers (Di Caprio in his star-confirming turn as a steerage passenger and Winslet as a very proper young lady engaged to wealthy cad Zane, all by the way perfect) facing the ultimate tale of survival as the vast ship of luxury and riches slowly begins to sink thanks to its fated collision with an iceberg in The North Sea.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's hard to believe that nearly nine years have passed since this movie came out. It's a masterpiece of special effects and storytelling, even if the romance schmaltzes it up a bit. I'm not too critical about films that stretch the truth. If that were not the case, we would only watch documentaries, and, of course, many of those are suspect. In addition to the incredible recreation of the Titanic and the people who sailed her, there is an air of mystery maintained throughout, accentuated by the incredible music score. The fact that we all know the story and the result makes us voyeurs to history. I enjoyed this movie, and yet it made me sad. I sat next to a couple of twenty something types with their baseball caps on backwards, yelling ""all right"" when a falling body would smack against an obstruction as it plummeted down the length of the capsizing ship. I sat in awe of the power of nature and imagined those poor people dying from the stupidity of an overconfident shipbuilder and captain. I know it's just a movie, but it had a really connection to my heart. The business with Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet didn't really grab me. What did was that there was a hopelessness beyond anything we can fathom. If you read my review of ""A Night to Remember,"" also a fine film from much earlier, you will see that it's about people saying goodbye to their wives and children and to another day that makes this event so horrible. It's quite a marvelous movie. We may have forgotten that in the wake of all the attention it received, including parodies and spoofs.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

The script was inane, leaving the viewer with only special effects for interest. In the very-near future, when high-tech special effects no longer dazzle audiences, this moneymaking venture will be re-evaluated.

","There has been nothing similar before and it's hard to imagine something like titanic will ever be created that masterfully & epic again.
I will not respond to any low ratings and leave these viewers alone with their well, opinion. To me TITANIC is the definition of perfection. It came to the absolutely right time. Maybe a few years earlier or later the impact to society would have been less big or even bigger? anyway it influenced a whole generation and even a decade later it has not lost a single spark. It's still the one and only benchmark for any movie. Titanic inspires young and old, brings everyone with a heart to tears and impresses with the highest level of detail in movie making. I'm so thankful I was part of the premiere and the re-screening.
Titanic delivers the perfect 10 on all levels. The attention to detail, eg the dishes and furniture have been all recreated 1:1 to the original. The cast, Katy Bates & esp Kate Winslet (who, in my opinion was shockingly robbed to win her 1st academy award. Alone for heart breaking deleted scene where she had a mental breakdown was one of the best performances by any actress !) and then of course the score: haunting & epic. Recognizable under millions of other melodies including the modern classic my heart will go on.

","""Titanic"",like ""Gone with the wind"" is one of the great unrateable movies. Just as GWTW caught the imagination of the public in its time so ""Titanic"" repeated the feat sixty years later.Neither one of them is a ""great"" movie in the artistic or intellectual sense,but both of them are great movies in terms of sheer populist entertainment and their grasp of the mood of the moment.Possibly even ""opportunist"" might be the right word. Both of them had huge lead roles and nothing much else for their actors,both featured highly unlikely romances between people from different social stratas.GWTW had the burning of Atlanta,brilliant state - of - the - art filming,and ""Titanic"" has the sinking of the ship which is hugely impressive by any standards. Ten years down the line it looks better to me than it did on it's release. Mr L. diCaprio,a little like a mixture of James Cagney and Mickey Rooney, is feisty and funny as Jack,Kate Winslet full of vitality and a slightly knowing innocence,hold the film together during its occasional longeurs,and their coupling is sweet and funny if highly unlikely. Forget all the ""buts"" and allow yourself to be swept along,lingering in the chandeliered dining rooms, strolling the endless decks and watch the stokers toil in the massive engine rooms like Dore's vision of Hell. The whole thing is a brilliantly assembled mish - mash of movie clichés one following the other seamlessly so that you don't care that you're watching sheer corn because it's so well done. The opening sequence with the 102 year - old Rose on the Diving ship is patiently built up with gradually lengthening flashbacks to 1912. The ending, where Rose,after telling her story goes out on the deck in the middle of the night and lets the priceless diamond she has had all along slip into the ocean then........no,on the remote chance that you haven't seen the movie I won't go any further.But I will pay the ultimate tribute to Mr Cameron and confess that I have watched ""Titanic"" six times and every damn time,no matter how much I tell myself I am being manipulated by a succession of still photographs being projected at just the right speed to cause persistence of vision..........I cry.

","I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it's about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it's engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today. I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D again and it was still good. And the conversion to 3D is done well.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2005,davidgoesboating,3," Alright film, but over-rated
","This may contain spoilers...... OK just a little bit of background to this review. Firstly, yes I was one of that 0.01% who did not see this movie at the cinemas when it came out. Secondly, when I did see it for the first time on TV last year, I missed the first 45 minutes. However, I saw enough of this movie to see how ridiculously over-rated it was. Firstly, the positives, and there weren't a whole lot. Number one: yes, the special effects were as good as they were supposed to be. The design of the Titanic was amazing. Also the bit at the end where the ship sinks was incredible. Number two: Kate Winslet has a nice body, and you do get to see a lot more of it than I thought you would...... although one could be a bit cynical about that scene, that they only put it in to get more people to watch it. That's about it for the positives. Now for the negatives: Leonardo Di Caprio can't really act. OK, I thought he did well in Romeo and Juliet (which is one of my favorite movies) but his acting and dialog are just really wooden in Titanic. The characters as a whole are just one-dimensional. One of the most laughable points was though how many life-or-death situations there are for Leo and Kate in the last hour (yes, the movie takes forever to finish). First Leonardo gets locked down below deck as the water level slowly rises (ooh will he survive????) and of course gets rescued by Kate Winslet after about 15 minutes. Then Kate's evil fiancée (yes not much room for development in that character) starts shooting at them so they have to run back 5 levels deep before deciding to go back on top. Here they face a literal ""class barrier"" (big metaphor there of course) a big iron gate, which, with help from the other battling workers, Leonardo bravely breaks down. Forgive my sarcasm, but it was hard not to roll my eyes throughout this whole sequence. Then after narrowly surviving half a dozen near-death experiences, Leonardo dies in the lamest way possible. Instead of attempting to find another piece of debris to float on in the water, he rather unnecessarily lets winslet have the whole piece of wood to float on, and lets himself freeze to death. But perhaps the worst part of all was the sequences where we go back to the old 101-year old version of Kate Winslet telling the story, with a bunch of young scientists passing social commentary on it.

","First time I saw it was on New Year's Eve 1997. It had only been out for 12 days at that point. Initially, I was reluctant only because I knew there would be underwater scenes, which I am afraid of, especially on a big movie theater screen. I saw it among a group of people at a Regal Cinemas. This is the first movie I have ever experienced in a stadium seating setting. Titanic is historic for many reasons. Honestly, I wasn't too familiar with the sinking of the Titanic. For me, experiencing this film at that time was, and will always be a game changer for cinema. I grew up watching cable TV, so I have seen many movies, but nothing could prepare me for what I was about to see in Titanic. It was one of the best experiences I've ever had in a movie theater, and although it was mostly packed, the people were into it. I'd say about the last hour and 25 minutes, I was in tears. The scene that did it for me was when Jack says to Rose, ""Why did you do that?! Why?!"" as they frantically embrace one another while next to the bottom of the staircase after she jumped back onto the ship. From there, I was a blubbering mess. Never seen anything like it. I was glad to see it in 3D when it was rereleased back in 2012. The 3D was so good, I briefly wondered why it hadn't been released that way in the first place, but it was already a gamble for the movie studios to begin with.

The music, a rich blend of instrumental and vocal, is far from archaic. It inspires emotional power that would have otherwise been lost. The story is obviously well-researched, the images are heartbreaking and breathtaking, and, unlike many epics, Titanic is not arrogant, and it does not drag on. In fact, despite its being one of the longest movies I have ever seen, it felt rushed. It was over too soon. It was that good. I did not even think that the love story was that distracting from the grandeur. It was just another human aspect masterfully explored by the film: greed, hate, panic, and, above all, love, a love so profound, so passionate, that it should inspire viewers with envy, not laughter. No, Titanic is as close to flawless as anything can get. With characters that should rightfully be hated and loved, characters to whom we can all relate, a recapture of the world of the past and the ship itself synonymous to a time machine, and a story replete with comedy, tragedy, and thrill, Titanic is a classic that time can never erode, and that shall always inspire laughter and tears.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie,""Titanic"", has great moments in it such as the dramatic sinking of the ship with all the intense desperation that event brought about in the crew and passengers as they struggled to live. There is no denying that movie has appealed to audiences around the world. Titanic fever has once again hit young and old and I'm sure books produced about this tragedy would have sold well. My frustration with the movie was not the special effects which were brilliant but rather the way in which the two main characters, Jack and Rose, acted in the movie. It was almost as if the two characters had hopped into a time machine and magically appeared on the deck of the Titanic behaving just as they would have done in our era. Who really would have tolerated the activities of Jack and Rose as they moved about the ship in such a free and easy way? The strict manners of 1912 were not the easy manners of our era. I for one did not shed a tear when Jack went under the water in 1912 as I would have done if he had drowned today (because today he would have been at least a real person of our time). The Jack in this movie is so out of place and time (and Rose is too liberated in her behaviour for that era - really the love scene in the car is a laugh a minute). The real heroes of the Titanic were the crew who sacrificed their lives for the safety of the passengers, the poorer passengers who lost their lives because of the preference given to the rich in allotting spaces on the lifeboats and those men who bravely remained behind to let their wives and children get onto the few lifeboats available. Fictional characters such as Jack and Rose simply created to appeal to a late 20th century audience do these real heroes of 1912 a great disservice.

","Yes, for a long time, I did avoid this one. Eventually, I realized that I had to; Cameron is talented enough to make this work. I've now seen every film he's directed, save for Piranha Part II(which I understand was taken away from him), and the man always does a nice job. No, not every single picture of his is excellent... but they're all worth the time(and with hardly any exceptions(and this certainly isn't one), the investment of emotions from the audience, as well), they entertain and he's yet to make the exact same thing twice(Terminator 2 is different from the original in notable areas, such as the tone). I don't blindly love all of them; I maintain that the quality of The Abyss lies mainly in the gorgeous under-water photography. He never phones it in, and he always has something to say, somewhere to go with what he does. I was apprehensive of the idea that this would focus on a small group of people(in particular, the two leads), when this was indeed something that actually did happen, and many were killed. However, when you think about it, it needed to be like that; that's what makes the incident(in this) have the devastating impact that I think we can all admit it does. Yes, the FX are amazing, and the production values offer a new definition of the term ""grandiose"" when applied to that aspect; the reason we ""feel"" it, though, is that we care about the ones we ""know"" to be on the ship. The characters are well-written, thoroughly developed, credible and all have something to do. Rose is a rather strong woman, and without it reaching anachronistic levels, either. She is not ""just a wife"", and she is fleshed out, something that many attempts at female role models neglect to do. The cast is spot-on, everyone is well-chosen. Every single acting performance is flawless. Arguably, this is somewhat black and white in its presentation of them; with that said, they are all convincing and have genuine personality. This is one of the greatest disaster movies, and epic love dramas, in the world of cinema. It is Hollywood and mainstream at its absolute best. Will it please everyone? Perhaps not, and probably not those who refuse to take it on its own terms. It was always clear what approach this took. And also, about hype... ignore it. Yes, you read that right. In this case and in all others, pretend like you can't hear what everyone is making something out to be, and watch what you feel like, as unaffected by popular opinion as you can be. Nothing can survive a viewing by someone who has heard nothing other than positives about it, regardless of its quality. The pacing is marvelous; for a running time of three hours, this is not boring at all. It has fun and humorous moments. Is it sappy? I suppose that's up to the individual to judge; I wouldn't say so. There is a bit of violence and disturbing content, infrequent mild to moderate language, a little sexuality(hinted at) and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer.

","Titanic is a fair work from director James Cameron. Sometimes being called on the carpet for it's naive plot and dialogue, this movie had the rare merit of reuniting the public and the critics in an unanimous way: James Cameron's Titanic is an effective work to be remembered. This does not happen so often. For several weeks, this movie had the privilege to score brilliantly on the top charts, as well as conquering major movie awards around the world. Is it fair? Was it overrated? That does not matter, if we accept it for what it stands. It worked perfectly. The artwork is ostentatious and the acting if not perfect is adequate and balanced with the strength of the script written by Cameron himself. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the necessary honesty to the role, while Kate Winslet grants the wit, elegance and grace that a romantic and troubled heroin should have. Miss Winslet was without any doubt the finest actress for the role. Apart from the supremacy of the visual effects, which are the main core of this movie for most of its viewers, Titanic dazzles for the truth and sensibility present in every single detail in every scene. More than a parade of mere flash-backs from an old lady who once was ""a dish"", this movie is a fine drama made with a solid sense of loyalty and respect for the viewer. You know what happens before you pay for your ticket. You know it is a love story set on a transatlatic and you know people will die. What matters, most of all, is the possibility Cameron gives you to imagine what might have been if you had the chance to find true love under the most ungrateful circumstances. 8 out of 10 for Cameron's sensibility and courage to write a story without having any previous experience as a screen-writer; 10/10 for a brilliant Kate Winslet, a beautiful and talented British actress who proved that acting skills do not have nationality nor beauty patterns.

Writer/director/producer James Cameron missed the memo. Cameron takes over an hour and a half to get to the meat and potatoes. It's time wasted. The first half of ""Titanic"" is long and tedious. The bookend story isn't that interesting. The voyage stuff is pure melodrama. The dialogue is corny with way too much ""explaining"". That stuff is informative but it never sounds real. For some reason the strong cast isn't very good either. Overall, they get a grade of C+. It's when ""Titanic"" hits the iceberg that the movie really comes alive. It's exciting and very emotional. The last hour or so is classic. I saw ""Titanic"" twice in the theater. Once when it first came out and the other time was for its 3D re-release.

","Titanic is Hollywood's biggest moneymaker in history and for good reason - it is a great movie. This movie is about sacrifice, selflessness, love, devotion, joy, passion, all occurring on a doomed ocean liner that suddenly and without warning sinks, resulting in one of the worst maritime catastrophes in history. Kate Winslett is magnificent as the young girl, Rose, barely a teenager, who is being pressured by her overbearing mother to marry Cal, a nasty, brutal man who has only contempt for his unwilling fiancé. That Cal is rich just makes his behavior worse. Rose, by nature a gentle spirit, is angry and desperate to escape, so much so that she is about to commit suicide when she is saved by a young man, Jack, who, despite his shabby appearance, is a well-traveled, sensitive and upbeat artist who treats the troubled young lady with gentleness and respect and she responds. Their love for each other is instantaneous and unconditional and they are willing to die for each other. This is not such an implausible scenario and there is absolutely nothing immoral about their behavior. Rose willingly gives herself to Jack out of love for him, and even decades later still thinks of him as her one and only true love, the man who died for her so she could live. That is love. That is sacrifice. That is life. That is Christian. That they were not formally married is a mere technicality. Given the circumstances of their meeting. a loving and understanding G-d will forgive them. Now regarding the diamond that was given to Rose, instead of cashing it in like she could have, she kept it as a memento to her one true love. That is called character. Nothing unchristian about that. Indeed, the movie is actually about how Rose undergoes a complete transformation from a passive, unhappy, moody adolescent into a composed, mature, independent and beautiful woman, even changing her name, now prepared to go on to live a long and active life. That is, she experiences an epiphany. That is called personal growth which is quite Christian and most exemplary. As for Jack, he is with Rose in spirit and she lives her life accordingly, knowing that if it were not for him she would not have survived. Jack gave his life for Rose so she could live.

","Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg.

This is not the first time a fictional story has found its way into a Titanic film (take the 1953 version with Clifton Webb for example). Being such a buff on the real Titanic, I did not like how so much of the film was focused on this story. What I really wanted was true historical facts about the tragedy shown on film. The story does not really need to be spiced up. It is tragic and fascinating, with tons of little interesting details, all on its own. It is truly a great story simply written by God himself. If you enjoy the romance between Jack and Rose, you're not alone. That seems to be why most people love this film. Nevertheless, I found all of the facts about the Titanic in this film to be completely accurate and well-portrayed. It is a worthwhile film for just about anyone. Not worthy of all 11 Oscars, though. ""Good Will Hunting"" is what should have won that year. Of course, this does have that great original song ""My Heart Goes On,"" definitely worthy of its Oscar.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

22 April 1999,rupie,4," redeemed only by the effects
","It is a sad commentary on contemporary taste that this movie has received so much critical and popular acclaim. It is redeemed only by its admittedly spectacular special effects. The acting of diCaprio & Winslet is sophomoric. The romantic storyline is improbable and saccharine. The Billy Zane role harks back to the ridiculous mustachioed villains of 19th century melodrama - laughably unbelievable. The score is a disgrace; a movie which aspires so high deserves a symphony orchestra and a John Williams, not the synthesized tin whistle effort it received. The portrayal of social class (everyone in First Class is an evil, repressed, sneering Capitalist Oppressor while everyone in Steerage is a vibrant, life-affirming peasant saint) is right out of a Marxist primer. diCaprio teaching Winslet to spit over the rail is both ridiculous and disgusting. And as for Cameron's ballyhooed fetish for historical accuracy, there is absolutely no evidence that any ship's officer committed suicide during the sinking (but it sure works great on screen, doesn't it?!). Further, he neglects to give a name to the infamous ship that lay 10 miles away and watched the Titanic sink while doing nothing (it was the Californian). And this is the 90's so we have to have our obligatory and gratuitous nude scene and sex scene, don't we (can't make a film without one nowadays)? Those with an interest in the Titanic (possible as a result of this movie) are directed to Walter Lord's incomparable book on the disaster ""A Night to Remember"", and the 1958 J.Arthur Rank production of the same name. Although the effects are not as great (it's 1958 after all) they stand up well, and the script, acting and whole tone of the movie are superior to this bloated and overrated ""blockbuster"". And those who glibly call this ""the best movie of all time"" are gently advised to go out and rent one or more from the following list - ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Spartacus"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Citizen Kane"".

","The producers and writers of Titanic obviously believed they'd bore and alienate the targeted teen and twenty-something audience to the point of losing them if the characters had the attitudes, mannerisms and style of speech that was appropriate for the time, so they had Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslett) speaking contemporary dialogue in a contemporary style, or at least contemporary for '97. A young man in 1912 would not say, ""You seem more like an indoor girl."" Aside from a certain hostile type of mental patient or the most outrageous and anti-social bohemian agitator, young adults in 1912 did not repeatedly tell their elders to shut up. The creators of the film are counting on what they perceive to be the teen and young adult's lack of knowledge or interest in the values and social customs of the very early 20th century. Since they want the audience to get swept away by the drama and romance of Jack and Rose they want them to relate to everything about them. I remember that this was billed as somewhat of a a fantasy re-imagining of a real event, but this type of historical revisionism, I think, in which human behavior is simply made more familiar, is an insult to any viewer with a 3-digit I.Q. One continuity problem that really gets me is how, when the ship is sinking and Jack and Rose are still inside, the water level is lower and the water becomes calmer around them every time they have a conversation. Again, the makers of the film don't want the reality of the disaster to encroach on, or distract us from, the passionate young romance they're trying to draw us into. Clearly the creators of the film think that the romance is a bigger draw for a major segment of the audience than the story of an enormous disaster that killed over 1,500 people and I'm sure they're right, but often when true and fictional stories exist in the same movie, one weakens the impact of the other, and it's certainly true in this case. I haven't seen the new 3D version but I assume the only change is the 3D effect. This is a bland, pandering, intelligence-insulting and epically overrated epic.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2000,chrisbrown6453,10," No matter how awful the situation may seem, beauty always has a way of showing itself; if even for a short time.
","Titanic opens with Brock Lovett (Paxton) and his crew as they begin to dive down 12,500 feet to the wreckage of the R.M.S. Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Sea on April 15, 1912.  The movie jumps from present day, to the day of that ill-fated voyage, then returns to the present day.  That unfortunate day begins with Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) winning a ticket to ride the Titanic back to America where he is from. While on board, he meets Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet), a woman being forced to marry a man she does not love.  While on board, Jack and Rose develop a loving relationship, and spend all their time together hiding their feelings from all those who oppose.  Titanic follows the two as they fall in love, evade the jealous ex-fiancé, Cal Hockley (Zane), and eventually watch as their very short time begins to come to an end due to the sinking of the great Titanic. 	Of the many characters that went through changes in Titanic, I chose to discuss Rose DeWitt Bukater, and why she represents a three-dimensional character.  When we first are introduced to Rose, we get the impression that she is a little `rich bitch.'  She pulls up on the boarding dock in a caravan of new cars, welding a barrage of luggage.  When she first lays eyes upon Jack, who is on the lower deck with the rest of the `commoners', she has already formed her inferior opinion of him.  It is not until Jack stumbles onto Rose attempting to leap from the aft of the Titanic, and saves her, does she begin to realize that he is not inferior, and instead an interesting man.  Rose soon begins to fall in love with Jack, and this is where we see her change from that `rich bitch' to a caring, lovable woman. We later find out that even though she let go of Jack by the end of the film, she carried the memory of him her entire life through the beautiful necklace she wore as Jack sketched her portrait. 	 Titanic is filled with irony, symbolism, and conflict.  The fact the Jack Dawson won his ticket to ride on Titanic, only to perish on it's very first voyage, is the first taste of irony that we experience.  Also, how heartbreaking is it that just after finding true love, they are split by the death of Jack?  Tragic. 	The greatest use of symbolism in Titanic occurs within the scene where Jack attends the dinner with Rose, Cal, and others.  This represents the life that Rose is bound to, and desperately seeking to escape.  The opposite happens when Jack takes Rose down to the lower deck, and we witness Rose expressing her most comfortable, newfound personality.  We also cannot forget the use of the diamond necklace.  The necklace ultimately represents Roses' undying love for Jack, which she has held onto all her life.  Only after she visits the wreckage of the Titanic is she finally ready to let go, and subsequently releases the necklace to the sea, and passes on in her sleep. 	As with many of James Cameron's films, Titanic uses numerous close up shots to convey intimacy.  A perfect example of this occurs in the scene when Jack is drawing the nude form of Rose.  Another technique that I feel James Cameron has mastered is the use of sound and/or music in his films.  A right sound effect, or musical score as in Titanic, helps to complete that scary slasher scene, or that sad death scene, or even that scene where words just cannot express the right feeling as in that beautiful scene in Titanic when the lifeboat is being lowered with Rose inside. 	The film Titanic is such that in my opinion could be considered as having both a realistic and romantic ending.  The fact that Jack Dawson died at the end makes it a realistic ending; while having Rose walking to the rear of the ship to toss the ever symbolic diamond necklace into the night darkened sea creates the feeling of a romantic ending. 	Titanic proves to not only push the envelope, but break it wide open with the masterful direction by James Cameron.  While Titanic's photography would reason to be realistic, it is by all accounts formalist.   The use of distorted camera angles, wide-angle shots, and camera movements make it such. 	As I earlier stated, the use of a great musical score in any film will make, or break that particular feeling the director wishes to convey.  It is said that realists films employ minimal musical scores, while formalist films come with big scores that are hard to ignore.  Titanic not only has the critically acclaimed `My Heart Will Go On' theme song, but many beautiful scores such as `Rose' and `Southampton' which, in this reviewers opinion, is the main reason this movie was as beautiful as it really was.

20 December 2009,the-gossip-king,10," Cameron's MASTERPIECE!
","For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Rose's and Jack's story alone, no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart won't go on from this one.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","At first glance, Titanic is an epic film. The scenery and cinematogrpahy are spectacular, and it is just a beautifully photographed movie. However, when you look past the superficial beauty of the film, much like Armageddon, its numerous shortcomings become clear. First of all, Titanic suffered badly from the transition from the big screen to video. This took away a lot of the hugeness of the film, and this inadvertently places more attention on the story and the acting, both of which were the biggest problems with the film. I went to see this movie to see the sinking of the Titanic, not to see some elaborately fabricated love story. ",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2019,StonedMagician,9," Excellent: 9.5
","So many romance movies come out these days, and so many of them have characters, stories, and relationships that are hopelessly difficult to care about. Who could have guessed that James Cameron, known for highly visual works like Terminator and Aliens, would create what is in my mind unquestionably one of the greatest love stories ever? If I had gone into Titanic blind, I certainly wouldn't have. I will get the few real flaws out of the way first. Leonardo DiCaprio, as great as he is in this film, is forced to yell commands to Rose a bit too much. And the 3D is a gimmick, nothing more. However, to my knowledge, this is the only way to experience this film in IMAX, so for me at least, wearing the glasses was well worth it. Though I'm sure I am overlooking some, that's about it for the bad. On to the good. Firstly, I hope that the rerelease of this acclaimed film will remind directors of romantically-minded movies everywhere of how to do it right. James Cameron starts the film in the present day (or at least, it was when it was released), with an expedition to the titular wreck overseen by an enthusiastic explorer (Bill Paxton). He finds a bunch of papers in a safe on the ship, and restores a drawing of a young woman naked, wearing only a necklace. This sets into motion a series of events leading to a three hour long flashback detailing Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet, played in the ""present"" by Gloria Stuart), and her passionate relationship with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). I could type for hours about how well-acted, emotional, and real this pair seems. I won't, but suffice it to say that all acting awards were well-deserved. For the bare majority of the film, Jack and Rose are in the spotlight. The length of the film actually works to its advantage, because ample time is given to see how their relationship springs, wilts, and ultimately blossoms. Jack is a lower-class man, and even he makes no bones about it. Rose is from the opposite end of the spectrum, and hates it. Jack finds he about to commit suicide over her marriage forced on her by her mother. The moments the two share really sell their relationship, enough so that the audience becomes invested as well. Class differences are an extremely prominent issue, brought up again and again. At one point, Rose reminds a frantic crewman that only half the ship's population can fit on the lifeboats. Her husband-to-be overhears this, and replies ""the better half."" The rich are not painted in a sympathetic light. They are arrogant, selfish, and terrible people that throw others off just to have themselves a little more space. Cameron goes this extra mile to ensure that we are sympathetic with Rose. She is forced to walk among these horrid humans, and finally, stumbles upon someone that treats her as an equal, and in an almost husband-like manner, as opposed to her stuck-up, borderline misogynistic fiancee. After almost two hours of engaging, superb relationship-building, the inevitable iceberg looms. This, of course, is where James Cameron's signature technical brilliance kicks in in full force. Metal is torn asunder, flooding commences everywhere, and there are many grand exterior shots showing the Titanic going down. All of which are done with excellent special effects that look as real as any of the characters in the midst of them. This is also where the movie becomes incredibly, brutally honest about what probably happened once the ship began to sink. Hundreds are shown drowning and falling, including children. The rich shun the poor, literally kicking them off lifeboats. SOS signals are sent, and fireworks are launched. And, in what could be the greatest scene in the film, four string instrument players lament the catastrophe the only way they know how. And through it all, Rose and Jack find each other through the worst of it, and stay alive until the last possible moment. James Cameron's work in this film is truly extraordinary. He is not known for crafting compelling characters or stories. However, in these respects, he succeeds brilliantly here. In modern romance films, characters and their tribulations are about as genuine as cardboard cutouts. Cameron has created a set, populated it with characters that fill it to the last inch, and bound it all together with great attention to artistic and technical detail. I left trying to sort out what I liked most about it. I haven't yet decided, but I knew then and know now that I have seen a beautiful masterpiece from the unlikeliest of sources.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2016,mike48128,10," A true classic-The ""GWTW"" of disaster movies
","Best version since the old ""A Night to Remember"" (1953). With all those reviews, I only need to ""touch"" on the synopsis of the film. 101 year-old ""Rose"", long thought to have died in the disaster, reappears as the wreck is examined and it's contents rescued yet again. The ""explorer-scavenger"" is fascinated both with the story and romance of it all, but especially the recovery of the romantic 58 Caret heart-shaped diamond necklace known as ""The Heart of the Sea"" which is worth more than the Hope Diamond. Did such a gem exist, or is it the product of the screenwriter's vivid imagination? It is a well-told tale and the time passes so fast that it doesn't seem like a 3 hour movie at all. Superb cinematography combined with seamlessly beautiful special effects and the best shipwreck ever filmed. Models and the CGI are most convincing. The Oscar-winning musical score and audio are amazing. The ships motors and interior looks entirely authentic. Kathy Bates has a wonderful ""minor"" role as the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown, and, as MGM used to say, ""a cast of ""more stars than there are in Heaven"". Billy Zane plays the deliciously mean and arrogant fiancée of 17-year-old ""Rose"",who is being forced to have pre-nupual sex, and marry a man she does not love, for his money. She hates it and is almost driven to suicide. One nude scene of a beautiful woman-child will offend only a minority of the viewing audience. (Rated PG-13. Also a few choice swear words.) Best ending ever (warning-huge spoiler) as ""Rose"" slips the huge blue diamond into the sea. The original DVD is letterboxed and not ""anamorphic"". Buy a later version, which is remastered for 16x9 TV. It is remastered to 1.78 format. I like to stop it around chapter 18 for an ""intermission"". ",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

The film is incredibly well paced- despite being quite long and the casting is top notch. Titanic made stars out of Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio and they are quite good here. One can see why Leo became a heartthrob after this film came out- he is very good. Jim Cameron has a passion for the Ocean and he seems right at home directing Titanic.

","This is probably the best example of a critic's grudge against a terrific film. Yes, the love story is clichéd and unoriginal. So what? Everything else is flawless. The effort James Cameron spent with the historical accuracy is commendable at least. Not so many times we can see a film set in a certain time period with appropriate costumes, set designs, silverware, etc. Even the actors were cast to be almost identical to their real life counterparts. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the dialog bad at all. There are no lines passing for catch phrases, like in other big budget movies. The visual effects, I'm speechless just to think about them. Even the love story, cheesy as it is, was greatly written, like in the old days. The acting was great, almost obliged to be great. The characters were amazingly portrayed, and Cameron made sure every single death would ache your heart (except for Lovejoy), something nobody really can do nowadays. Of course, there is the nude scene with Kate Winslet, something for all those pre-teens out there, and the little sex scene inside the coach. Aside of building up the romance between Rose and Jack, both scenes prove to be a little pointless. Even though, James Cameron is who actually draws the Rose picture, so that really gives more of an artistic merit. Music, well, it's good, and I don't mean just that song you all know.

But, even setting aside my disdain for his gross inaccuracies in Titanic history, and going with my deepest feelings that films are for enjoyment and escapism, this movie lacked the most important part of any film developing characters: I didn't care about Rose or Jack.  Rose was spoiled.  Jack was a foolish brat.  This film also contained the fatal flaw in triangle love stories: I liked the bad guy. Billy Zane, beauty aside, was still the only character who probably was on the Titanic, and the only one I hoped made it off the ship alive.

The computer generated graphics were so obvious, esp. when they did overhead shots of the ship sailing through the ocean (polygon people anyone?). Still however there are always good sides to every bad thing, and the sinking of the ship was a feast for the eyes. It was almost like you were there! The details on the whole were very accurate and the costumes were gorgeous. The ending was very sad, and gave a human face to the tragedy, but it didn't erase the first three-quarters.

1 December 2006,chrisbishop5000,10," The most breathtaking love story ever! MUCH better than ""Gone With The Wind""
","This film is underrated and yet so beautiful! In 1997, the world was introduced to a heartbreaking, uplifting film which provides you 3 hours and 20 minutes or so with romance, adventure, danger, the spirit of kindness, offering the person you love your own life (just like Jack Dawson did for Rose). I ask you - what more can a movie give you? Tell me that! Even the scenes like when Rose takes off her clothes and Jack draws her naked, and the moderate/strong bad language which comes in frequently doesn't put me off. I think the certificate should've been 15+. I personally do not think the mature sequences in this movie are suitable for a big kid aged 12. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are the our stars in this outstanding epic. Their characters are far from similar because Rose is rich and she mixes with snobby people and yet she doesn't like them at all and she's also feisty. Jack is poor and likes to hang out with his mates and despite his rough edges, he has a heart of gold! He is such a loving, selfless young man who even took his own life. Anyway, when Rose can't put up with being somebody she doesn't want, she bolts out of Titanic's main restaurant and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off the ship. Jack sees what she's doing and insists that she doesn't drop off the railing. At first she tells him to goaway, but he holds out his hand and she gives him her hand. She slips and nearly falls into the sea. He uses all his strength to lift her back onto the boat. From then, they gradually fall in love with each other. This feature-film makes me cry big tears every time I see it. I sob in the same way a person would do if they were mourning the death of a loved one. I feel as if I may not stop crying for at least an hour after the film finishes. Even some of the scenes that aren't sad make me cry. Like; when Jack feels upset when Rose tries to avoid him because she's engaged to Cal Hockley (a heartless and violent man) just to please him but the evening of the day when she tells him not to keep seeing her she has a sudden change of mind and comes to see him at the front of ""Titanic"". He reaches for her hand and tells her to step up onto the railing, let her arms spread out while he supports her and then she believes she's flying and at that point they kiss. It's shot beautifully against evening pink skies - it's just so tearful, knowing this couple are sharing their final evening together and- (Sniffles). Rose says to Jack ""Jack when the ship docks, I'm getting off with you!"", sadly, what I say is ""you mean IF the ship docks!"" and from there all the tragedy of Titanic's collision into the iceberg will come in in only a short matter of time. When it happens Jack is held prisoner right at the bottom of the ship and they leave him there even when the ship is sinking! Luckily, Rose comes to his rescue and releases him. Then, as Rose is rich and Jack is poor, Rose is forced to board a boat and as it lowers he hand which is holding Jack's is pulled away. Cal Hockley menacingly says to Jack as she leaves, ""I always win, Jack"" - uh, not this time buster! But she leaps off the lifeboat and runs to his arms. He runs to her, too, and that's also too emotional to be true. But there's more tragedy to come. When the entire ship sinks to the bottom, after ""the ship's arse snaps"" as that man said at the beginning, Jack and Rose spot a board afloat but it's too small for them BOTH, so very selflessly, Jack lifts her onto the board and he stays in the freezing water. ""You have got to promise me that you'll survive, that you'll make babies and watch them grow. Promise me, Rose, that you'll die a little old lady warm in her bed. But not here, not this night! That divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me it brought me to you. Please, make me that promise."" He kisses her hand for the last time. Rose later tells Jack there's a boat to save them - but he doesn't answer or even move. He has frozen to death. Rose cannot believe it but bravely lets him sink; now I know I'll cry! WHAT A SAD MOVIE!!! But, despite its trauma, ""Titanic"" is irresistible. Over 15s won't be able to help but succumb to its beauty. Far better than the offensive ""Gone with the Wind"". Rose may be feisty but she's certainly not a self-obsessed harpy like Scarlett O'Hara and Jack Dawson is anything but that arrogant cad Rhett Butler, the womanising scumbag!

14 May 2014,Eightiesjunkie,1," How low the mighty have fallen!
","To begin with, I liked James Cameron as a director. As a matter of fact, Aliens is my all-time favorite movie. Throughout the 80's and mid 90's James Cameron could do no wrong, then it happened: Christmas 1997 James Cameron released the most overrated, over-hyped piece of garbage that the world has ever known: Titanic! I don't buy for a second, that Cameron cared about the real tragedy, the victims, or the heroes! I firmly believe that Cameron's sole intention for making this movie was to fatten his wallet! Critics praised it as a masterpiece, Teen and preteen girls swooned, and before you knew it, this rancid, vomit inducing, cinematic travesty became the highest grossing movie of all time! Before I begin, let me just clarify one thing: I don't hate this movie because it was a hit, I hate this movie for much more than that! So the film begins with treasure hunters exploring the wreck of the Titanic. They're searching for something, but we don't know what that exactly is yet. They find an old safe, and decide to bring it up to the surface. They cheer, pop champagne bottles, and celebrate that they've found what they've been looking for. However, once the safe is opened, they only find an old drawing of a woman wearing a diamond necklace. Some time later, a local news station does a story on the treasure hunters' expedition. An old woman watching the news story recognizes the drawing, contacts the leader of the expedition, and they bring her to where they are. We find out that they are searching for that lost diamond necklace, and that she is the woman in the drawing. So the film then goes into her story, and to sum it all up, we get the same old cliché-ridden love story, we've all seen before! Two people from two different worlds fall in love, and everything is working against their union. Some of you out there might be thinking that I hate this movie because I'm a guy, and generally, guys hate love stories. but that's not the case. I liked the movie Moulin Rouge, and I loved the movie The Notebook. The difference between those movies and this movie is: They actually did something NEW with that basic plot! Unlike Titanic, in which the only thing ""new"" is that that it happens on the Titanic. In the story, we meet characters that have the names of real people. These people include: Captain E.J. Smith, Designer Thomas Andrews, Builder Bruce Ismay, Crewman William Murdoch, and passengers, John Jacob Astor and ""The Unsinkable"" Molly Brown. Do we learn anything about these people or what happened to them? NO! These Characters are nothing more than plot devices! THIS, is the reason why I hate this movie! It is an insult to these people's family and memory to portray them this way! Specifically, William Murdoch's and Molly Brown's. In reality, these people were heroes! In this film however, Molly Brown is used as a comic relief, and William Murdoch, is made into a villain! James Cameron, How dare you!! In 2001, the movie Pearl Harbor was released, and everyone hated it. People have said that the movie was poorly written, the plot was horribly cliché, and that it makes a cheap mockery of a real life tragedy. What people fail to realize is: This is exactly what Titanic was! Why is Pearl Harbor labeled as cinematic tripe and garbage, while a few years earlier, Titanic did the EXACT same thing and it's labeled a masterpiece! If you're going to hold Michael Bay's feet to the fire for Pearl Harbor, you might as well do the same to James Cameron. I know a lot of people still love this movie, and that's fine, to each their own. In my opinion however, there will never be enough hatred for this film, Even if everyone in the world turned around and suddenly hated it, it still wouldn't be enough!",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic rocks, combining elements of dark brooding drama with all the T&A of a typical late night cinemax show.  With the president held hostage and locked in a frigidaire 200 feet under the ocean, Scotland Yard calls in the help of their #1 hit man to save the world.  He is TITANIC, a cyborg soldier genetically altered so that his face looks kinda like a bull when he gets miffed.  When the enemy organization known as D.U.M.B. (Democratic Underground Mob Brigade) finds out, they threaten to destroy the world with the help of their evil underlings, GWAR.  With the plot laid out, the action explodes as our hero fights his way across the world to save the helpless president (played by Lloyd Bridges) and maybe kill a few bad guys on the way.  Check this film out.

","First of all, as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost threw up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause. Is this an intelligent film?

","Just as the ship that couldn't be sunk sank in 1910, the movie ""Titanic"" which should not have failed went belly up and fell to the bottom of the sea. I seem to be going against the grain here and maybe I was the only one seeing this movie who didn't get it. I readily that there are great moments in this movie. The dramatic sequence where the Titantic ship becomes flooded with water and eventually sinks to the bottom is brilliant. What director James Cameron also does very well in exposing the sheer unfairness that some were allowed on the life boats, while others were not. In that connection, there was a emotive scene with a navy officer who, often against his own will, enforced this unfair system to the letter, not because it was the right thing to do, but because there were only so many life boats to go around and the prevailing view was that the few life boats available should go to the rich -- with the result that the rest were, in effect, left to die.

Winslet played a teenager (she was 17. yes, a teenager) trapped in an arranged betrothal not fitting into the upper class she was born into, to perfection. Dicaprio played the poor underclassmen with a compassion you need several views of this film to understand, to perfection. I've learned many new things every time I've seen this movie.

I am a James Cameron fan, I own all of his other films on cassette. What can I say. The film was boring, the acting was horrible. DiCaprio was laughingly bad, and he actually thought he deserved an Oscar nod. Billy Zane played the best character in the film, honestly. His character was the most entertaining character.Too bad so many people were blinded by DiCaprio's looks and did see the bad acting flowing from him. The special effects were poor. C'mon, long black bars representing the night sky. Mushy looking computer generated faces put over stunt peoples faces to make them look like DiCaprio and Winslet. There is no way that DiCaprio could swim up to the surface of the water after being pulled in by such a huge undertow. The special effects guys forgot to add frozen breath in many of the sequences that take place in the frigid water. Also during that scene you can here soundstage echos. DiCaprio sure spent a lot of time talking about places he had been to, which is fine, considering they did not exsist back then. Oh yea, It was sure nice of DiCaprio to turn his back on his apparent life long best bud for Winslet. What a nice guy. Look closely as Leo enters, the dining hall, you can see the reflection of a big camera and some crew guys carrying it. And if you adjust ticket prices for inflation, Titanic is not even close to being the highest-grossing film of all time. Gone With The Wind, E.T., and even The Star Wars Trilogy would have earned more. Too many Titanic fans brag about that. Kate Winslet did not need to be naked in that film. Also, her older version in the 90's could not have remembered all those facts about the ship. Bill Paxton was wasted in this film.

Titanic was a romance with a story that has been told before, too many times to count.  The inaccessible girl, the boy who must overcome the odds, including a better-placed suitor, to get the girl.

","Why do I love this movie? ...where to begin?? To start out with, I'm a male and couldn't care less for DiCaprio. I went to see the film because I thought the sinking scenes looked cool. I still remember sitting in the theater watching the opening scenes and wondering what the hell I was watching. It wasn't what I expected. I sat watching with slight interest, a beautiful love story but I was always anticipating the iceberg's appearance. By the time the ship did begin sinking the love story had worked it's magic, I cared for Rose and Jack, I cared for the passengers and crew and Somehow I found myself hoping against logic that the ship wouldn't sink. When Jack died and Rose begins ""1500 people went into the sea..."" I was crying harder than I'd ever cried and I've never cried at a film before or since. It just hit me like a ton of bricks that 1500 people died the same way jack did, and while jack may have never existed, those other 1500 did. Some people bash this film for the love story, but it helps the audience relate on an emotional level and offers an unforgettable experience if you open your heart to it. For the last 15 minutes or so I kept hoping it wouldn't end because I doubted any ending would be satisfactory.

","Before anything, let me say that this was a very good movie: the special effects were incredible, and the final hour was spellbindingly powerful. And if the entire movie had been about this, had been about the Titanic itself, then I would have loved it. However, it wasn't. Instead, it supplies us with two and a half hours of a boring, predictable, badly written and badly acted romance that is no different than any other movie romance that has been seen in the past 10 years. Let's see: a pretty girl is engaged to a rich snob because of pressure from her parents, and then a young drifter (who looks suspiciously like a 25 year-old model) ""rescues"" her, and they fall in love. Gee, no cliches so far. Some of the script was awful. For example, at the beginning, Rose says, ""You think you can save me?"" and Jack responds, ""No, only you can do that."" That's fine, except then at the end, old Rose tells her granddaughter, ""there was a man named Jack who saved me, in all the ways a person can be saved."" Which is a total contradiction to what Jack told her. And the worst line of the whole movie (or any movie I've seen in recent years): the ship is going down. Right in front of their eyes thousands of innocent men, women and children are dying. So what does Rose do? She looks at Jack, smiles, and says, ""Look honey, this is where we first met!"" How dramatic! I wanted to puke. I realize that I'm nitpicking here, but my point is, if you're going to make a drama about such an important event, why give us two hours of watching Kate Winslet spit over the edge of a ship and other such things? I've met some morons say that they consider this to be the ""greatest movie ever made."" Say WHAT?! Better than Star Wars? Better than The Godfather? Better than Casablanca?

","Titanic really isn't very involving in terms of its drama as it starts out. At this point, main thing that can be really worth observing is the camera work.  There are numerous long shots the movie progress, you are able to gain more of a interest with the story around the ship and its atmosphere. It that can help grab a hold on to the scenery fairly well.  As occasionally cuts back to the present day setting were the movie begins but not on a constant basis.  The drama itself at times feels to be lacking.  It tends to force several situations for dramatic impact.  Most of the bulk in Titanic belongs to the sinking of the ship.  The process of these action sequences is seemingly carefully and well constructed but along the way, it falls into various repetitious situations and dialog (e.g. the lines ""Come back"", ""Oh shi*"", and ""Never let go"").  For example, we either see children standing around and crying or crew members (who set an example of the one-dimensional supporting characters and in the process of this type of scenes usually gets punched) arguing with a group of passengers who paths are blocked.  Any other way, this period in the movie (albeit going on forever) is still interesting since it's obviously at moment of panic.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first half of this movie focused on a romance that I did not care about, and yet, I was still somehow engrossed by it all.

For every scene after the iceberg is first spotted, however, I can fully understand why I loved this movie so much.  The action scenes in this film are absolutely jaw-dropping, and this fact is the primary reason why this is one of my favorite films.  However, I can certainly agree with those who found this to be a real tearjerker. Seeing so many innocent people preparing to die is heartbreaking in the extreme, and these scenes will always stand out as some of the finest that I will ever see.

It was nothing like the real sinking of the Titanic, and they made too many mistakes, which you will notice if you watch carefully. I'm a fan of Camerons work, but this was simply an attention seeker movie, like 'Godzilla'. It shouldn't have gotten all the Oscars because there were better movies, with much better standards. The only Oscars it deserved to win was best song, and best music, which was the only good thing about this movie. If you wanna see a real masterpiece see 'Good Will Hunting' or 'Sliding Doors'.

The incredible storytelling ability of Cameron, his audacity with special effects, and his casting prowess (who would have thought that by casting an ugly girl against a attractive guy, he would create the romance of the decade?) It's incredible hokum. What so many of the Anti-Titanic camp fail to realise is that bad acting, duff script, and glossy special effects don't necessarily mean a bad film (Star Wars as an example). The key point here is that Cameron's huge ability to target the world's biggest niche audience (the dumb middle class) is something that should be celebrated. He should be a role-model for all film makers out to make a financial success - exploitation is the key. I can sum this up in one sentence: The brains behind this picture deserve to have the $1.8billion success - the film itself doesn't",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

Each shot is well done. I like how anything not having to do with roses family or jacks friends actually happened. They had more that you can see in their numerous deleted scenes. All the actors were brilliant. I was surprised when I heard Kate Winslet in her British accent. The music was flawless.

27 November 1998,jmcgraw7,," how to make Titanic perfect
","This is the second time I am writing about this movie, so obviously I liked it very much, despite its many flaws. Why else would I waste my time writing about it? My earlier entry pointed out what I thought was great about Titanic, as well as what was wrong with it. I have given it more thought, and will now suggest ways I believe it could have been the perfect movie, instead of just a very good one. 1. Keep the love triangle in, but reduce the three leads' screen time (they were not *that* interesting). Instead, develop some of the other characters, especially Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) and perhaps Bruce Ismay and Tommy Ryan (Jack's Irish friend who gets shot) as well. Movie would wind up with several interesting intertwined stories (including a couple of historic ones) and more on those characters who really *were* interesting. 2. The subplot involving the diamond was silly and unecessary--you could get the old Rose in without that unbelievable and contrived situation. She could just be there because she's the oldest surviving passenger, for instance. It would still work. The movie would even work without the ""bookends"" at all, and be a lot shorter, although I understand it's a convenient way to get the footage of the real wreck in the movie, which is extremely interesting and well done. 3. The Jack and Rose characters should be played by different actors. Winslet, though a good actress, is just a little unrefined and unbelievable as a first-class passenger. Claire Danes or Gwyneth Paltrow would have been better (though I understand Danes was actually considered but declined the role). Dicaprio is too young and frail looking. Since the role is not a difficult one, *any* decent actor could have played Jack. But he should at least have a little meat on his bones! 4. Make the Jack character a bit more interesting a/o complicated. He was too ""perfect"" and therefore not very compelling. Give him a fault or two. Rose had plenty to spare! 5. Put some of the important events leading to the sinking back into the script, i.e., the Californian ignoring pleas for help, the wireless operator's role in the tragedy. Even if the movie were a *little* longer it would have made a big difference without being *too* long. (I understand that the latter was actually included in the original script but was left on the cutting room floor...why?) 6. Give the wonderful Victor Garber (Thomas Andrews) a LOT more to do. He was by far the most interesting character in the movie, seemed very deep and complex, and left me begging for more. Of all the actors, I think he was the best in the movie. 7. Don't portray *all* the first-class passengers as third-class people. This is just not the way it really happened. First of all, on the real ship, the third-class passengers were *not* locked behind--it simply took them longer to get to where the life-boats were. Also, many first-class passengers performed heroic deeds, i.e., Isador Straus and his wife (seen briefly during the band sequence as they lay on their first-class bed waiting to drown) refused to be saved, giving up their lifejackets and insisting on drowning together... People are people, and in such a tragic situation, you would see the entire range of heroism vs. cowardice in *all* the passengers, whether first, second, or third class. 8. On James Cameron's Titanic, the second class has mysteriously disappeared. Where were they? What were *their* circumstances like? (I presume they would be the middle class, as most of *us* are!) All in all, a very good movie, and perhaps I am nitpicking. But I liked it so much and have seen it so many times, I just cannot resist putting in my 2 cents.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

Spoilers of Pearl Harbor! In Pearl Harbor, the girl thought Rafe (Ben Affleck) died, so she moved on to Danny (Josh Hartnett). The love story had nothing to do with the iceberg crashing. The love story was actually needed in Pearl Harbor. Also Pearl Harbor had to do with U.S. history. I know some of the parts are false history, but  some of it is true.

People who have not seen this movie on a large screen cannot say that they've seen this movie.  Period.  So go away.  I will agree with most and say that the acting is pretty bad (and the movie did not pick up any Oscars in the acting category).  James Cameron may be an arrogant jerk. And the screenplay is corny.  But the sheer awesomeness of the film is what I remembered when I saw it on the big screen in 1997.  Cameron, despite his personal faults, took us on that doomed luxury liner, literally transporting us back to 1912.  Yes, it could be argued that movies like ""A Night to Remember"" were better examinations of Titanic's final hours, and IMAX productions like Titanica had better footage of the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic.

However, the poignant relationship between Jack and Rose failed to faze me at all; the whole ironic situation at the end affected me little.  I couldn't really empathize with such sappiness; I felt like the characters and even the whole 'tough love' story were unnecessarily cliche. Also, it took WAY too long.

I found  none of this in there. It is obvious from the start (from her surroundings at home) that Winslet has survived without her love, that she has lived her whole life in memory. But on a more technical side, I found the Fx lacking the immaculate touch that was needed (and, by many, seen) to create the real feeling of the disaster. Signs of bad Fx are everywhere, from the boat's surrounding water to the people falling from the deck once it has gone vertical. It all feels fake, and that is for me an instant turn-off. I also failed to see the magic between the two main actors, although I do think DiCaprio is a good actor, and Winslet is usually OK, at least for me. Only, not here. So here I am, out of curiosity having finally seen a movie everybody thought wonderful, and feeling very disappointed. Missing any suspense from the situation, and non-thrilled by the love-story, I found myself wondering what all the people saw in there that I did not.

But it took so long to finally arrive at this point in the movie, it was almost impossible to get back into it by that time.  This movie was thoroughly uninteresting, and the only redeeming factor that comforts me is that there will never be a sequel. 1/10",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic is a fairly good movie, but I personally think the historical part of the movie seemed to be more touching and overall better then the love story between Jack and Rose. Their relationship seemed to have all of the aspects that every Hollywood romantic-fantasy has: the two young lovers are breaking the social code to be seeing each other, they're both young enough to pass as teenagers..(which, in this film, I think they are) , there is a steamy scene, and it has a touch of tragedy. Well, it's all very predictable but James Cameron did a wonderful job with the story of the ship Titanic. I found that part more touching and realistic than the love story. You really can see the passenger's terror and panic during the sinking sequence. Its all very saddening to watch because, as you watch it, you know that it actually happened many years ago. The amount of detail put into it was incredible, from the ""woman and children first, first class first"" to the musicians staying aboard to play, the fireworks... all very nice to watch.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","First I'm gonna admit that for 4 months I was ranting about this movie from ocean to ocean.  Telling people that if you want to see a ship movie that is worth it, go see Das Boot.  Well April 19th I finally went to see the movie.  I went in thinking maybe 2 1/2 -3 star and came out emotionally spent.  I'm a guy and when a movie hits you that hard, I end up liking the movie so much.  What really made this movie worked was James Horner's score.  Only he could have done it.  I'm not one of those obsessed people who decided to see the movie 90 times (couldn't afford that even if I wanted to), I don't go out and buy the calendars, puzzles, shirts, diamonds related to the movie.  I do like reading about Titanic's history.  I like to take photographs, seeing old photographs makes the feeling the more real.   Contrary to many people, I think Kate Winslet is the star of the show and not Leo.  He's almost a non issue except that if not because of Leo, Kate would be wandering about God only know where or dead already. I hope Kate Winslet gets some movies worth her talent.  I know Leo's Man behind the Iron Mask was less than expected. So he's not perfect either. When I watch a movie I try very hard not to think about the politics of a movie.  Want a good way to ruin a movie, that's a good way how.  It's hard to believe that someone who completely hated the movie decided to see it. (which is dumb anyway. you can't complain until you see it, then you have every right to.)  This is only the second time since I began watching movies that my opinions about a movie have changed so dramatically.  The other was the highly controversial movie Last Temptation of Christ. (for which for over 5 years I refused to watch it.)  Well I better quiet down , and go back to reviewing movies just for friends..... it's a hobby of mine..

The real excitement hit when the boat hit the iceberg.  The movie kept my attention from then on out.  Many people say that this movie is the best movie ever created.  I beg to differ.  In my opinion, the best movie ever made is Gone With the Wind.  You just can't compare to such an epic.  Titanic doesn't even come close.  When you really boil the movie down, it merely is a dressed up romance with an action/adventure tagged onto it.

","Titanic was a heart-warming true story that touches the chord of your heart and feel sympathize for those thousands of innocent people killed in one of the most horrifying accident. A young aspiring painter meets a high class rich girl on the deck of Titanic and falls in love with her. Unfortunately , their love story is short lived as they face off the ill-fated disaster when their ship struck the iceberg and slowly sinks in the sea. Reviewing Titanic would be a little absurd for me as this one is a masterpiece by legendary director , James Cameron. I just came back after watching the 3D version of the film and I felt that I've seen the flick for the first time even though I've seen it 14 years back when it broke all the records in domestic as well in international circuits. I have always been an immense admirer for Cameron's work right from Terminator series till the visually enthralling Avatar. He not only gives his best shot but also works on the minute details to make his film a must watch. Similarly , he directed Titanic and gives a detailed level explanation of what really happened on the tragic night of 14th April , 1914. The screenplay and writing should be given full marks. The cinematography and art direction are grandeur giving a feeling of living Titanic through 194 mins. Background score by James Horner is so intriguing that it gels well with the mood of the film. Performances by Leanardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is worth mentioning. They were young and relatively new when they did the film but I must tell you , they were superb. Overall , very emotional and heart-touching film in every sense that has re-written the history and will be immensely liked by people of all ages.

","I've read a few comments about this version of Titanic and most comments seem to be written by 20 or 30 somethings who probably don't know the first thing about the real sinking of the Titanic. One comment said that he was in his thirties and that he was taken away by the fictional story intertwined with ""actual"" facts. Not true. The Titanic did not break in two as seen in this fantasy and the director simply ignored the fact that the Californian was only 10 miles away from the Titanic. So the ""actual"" facts were skewered. Secondly, at that time in history no one in steerage would be allowed to mingle with first class passengers and the young girl's background would have never allowed her to go against her mother's wishes. What seemed to have made the movie a smashing success is that Cameron did what Margret Mitchell did in Gone With The Wind, he took a modern girl and thrust her into an earlier society, and the teens - especially young impressionable girls - were carried away by the simple minded story. It would seem that most girls want to be ******* in the back seat of a car by the town ""bad"" boy. Finally, unlike the 30 something man who thought that Cameron had succeeded in the second half of the sinking, I ""never"" once thought that these people were on the Titanic, just a large ship. I have to admit that I too have seen thousands of movies and the only time I was carried away by the sinking of Titanic was the 1959 version called A Night To Remember based on an ""actual"" account of the tragedy by an eye witness,Lord Walter Lord. But, alas, any of these viewers would call that film a documentary, a dry word indeed. Heck, even the Clifton Webb, Barbara Stanwyck version seemed closer to the sinking that this over blown version.

20 January 2007,de_niro_2001,10," Fabulous!
","I can't understand why this film has come high in polls for the worst ever film. It is very well made and won 11 Oscars. It is far better than the old films about the disaster. The acting is excellent and the effects take your breath away. It wouldn't have been any more realistic if James Cameron had commissioned a shipyard to build a full-scale working replica of the ship. The film is very authentic with just one minor lapse, namely the American locomotive and rolling stock on the dockside railway seen in front of the Titanic in the view from the pub. Unlike previous films about the Titanic there is no sense of impending doom throughout the film. There is a good feeling in the first half of the film, with scenes like Jack and Fabrizio at the bow watching the dolphins while Captain Smith looks on paternalistically and the ceilidh in steerage that Jack takes Rose to. James Cameron conveys the sheer size and stability of the ship very well and the audience is drawn into the very deep security that the passengers felt. Everybody on board is very friendly apart from certain individuals in First Class. Cal Hockley is a violent overgrown spoiled brat monster child. In a lot of scenes, particularly where he shoots at Jack with a handgun, he is reminiscent of the caddish upper class villain in a silent film. Jack has been criticised for being too 1990s but the rest of the cast look and act right for the period. The crew talk authentic sounding Edwardian English. James Cameron has caught the feel of the period very well and he has said that the people in the film are in many ways not that different from us today. It's fair to say that Jack and Fabrizio are like a couple of gap year students hitch-hiking round the world. Kate Winslet, with her full curvy figure which has got her a lot of period roles and the nickname ""Corset Kate"" is spot on as Rose. The scene where Jack sketches her nude is very touching and the piano music that accompanies it is lovely. When they run past the stokers one can feel the scorching heat of the furnaces. After the ship strikes the iceberg the audience has much the same incredulity as the passengers and most of the crew that there is a possibility of the ship sinking. The sinking, as it was in real life, starts very gradually and becomes progressively more terrifying. Although there is no blood or gore shown it still is horrifying. The only blood during the sinking are the scenes where the stewards get punched. There are some really sad scenes during the sinking such as the drowned woman floating in the water and the Irish mother telling her children the old Celtic story of Ossian and Niamh. It is sad when Fabrizio is killed by the collapsing funnel and when Tommy Ryan is shot by First Officer Murdoch in the heat of the moment. Incidentally, 20th Century Fox sent one of their executives over to Scotland to apologise to the people of Dalbeattie, Murdoch's home town, about the way he was portrayed in the film. One really feels the freezing cold when Jack and Rose are in the water and I felt sad when I saw the dead baby in its mother's arms. When I saw the film in the cinema I can remember hearing a couple of girls crying during and after the sinking. James Cameron says he deliberately made the ending ambiguous and his answer to the question of whether Rose dies or is dreaming at the end is ""You decide"". I think she died and went to Heaven and was reunited with all these people she'd known on the ship. It is a beautiful scene where she's reunited in Jack and she's all in white like a bride. Hey! I'm going against my own principles. I'm one of the most unromantic guys in the world! I'm not supposed to like these scenes!",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was looking through these reviews last week contemplating whether or not I should see this movie again upon its 100 year anniversary 3D release. I was looking to see if anyone had reviewed yet, more on the film's re release in its 3D glory - sadly they hadn't so I though if i want to know if its worth the price tag I will have to go. Considering myself to be interested in the titanic - not enough to call myself a Titanorack mind - I have learnt a lot about that ship, whether it be on the t.v or in books. Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to don on the 3D glasses required and watch the movie. James Cameron is the king of 3D. 3D to me being pretty much a gimmick which i think only works with made for 3D films on the big screen only. Avatar is the perfect example of this. Although i didn't care for the film much the 3D is sensational. Made for 3D movies such as Avatar and Piranha etc I have enjoyed and found them effective. You can see a lot of effort has gone into the 3D for Titanic. Some of the scenes are magnificent. The lifeboats rowing away being the best 3D scene for me in the film. Was that worth the price of the ticket? I am very undecided. I love this film and have seen it numerous times and I am not sure 3D added anything extra to the film because it wasn't made for 3D it didn't have the same effect for me. I think for me it was a chance again to see the film of the big screen which I enjoyed again very much. One thing I did think about on seeing it in 3D yesterday was why on earth was Billy Zane in this film? He is more hammy than William Shatner in Star Trek and not in a good way. But where this film is concerned my heart will always go on ..so if you want to know if its worth going to see in 3D I would say if you are a massive fan or never seen it before yes, otherwise not..",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

The effect is good but it still doesn't make the audience sit on the edge of their seats. The acting is dry, lacking any charisma and the result is like watching William Shatner for a few hours.

","For the people on here who commented that Titanic was the ""worst movie they've ever seen,"" apparently they haven't seen ""Showgirls"" or anything with Anna Nicole SMith. Give me a break guys. James Cameron did a phenomenal job with this movie; it truly brought the Titanic disaster back to life. Mr. Cameron did hundreds of hours (if not thousands) of research on the Titanic, including getting the poignant footage under water of the ship. A lot of facts and history with the Titanic disaster was incorporated into this movie,, giving us all the more reason to love it. Though it was over 3 hours long, I was not bored for one minute and that's very unusual for me to be able to sit through a movie this long. I was captivated by the love story and suspense Mr. Cameron created. The theme song "" My Heart Will Go On"" was perfect for the movie but it was terribly over played on the radio stations during this time. The ending was magnificent and I think everyone in the theatre cried, knowing that almost 2,000 people perished in the end. Yes, there were a couple of corny lines in the movie but no movie is perfect. I think the special effects used while the ship was sinking and the passengers were loading up in the boats, was extremely realistic and just moving. The replica ship used was also incredible. I think both Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio were fantastic in the lead, though I think Ms. Winslet was a little miscast since she looks a lot older than Leo. I have seen this movie several times and still watch it when it's on television. I do not think any other Titanic movie is superior to this one. **** 1/2 stars out of 5.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

This is the nearly completely accurate depiction of the 1912 disaster of the ""unsinkable"" Southampton launched cruise liner Titanic. One of the biggest ships ever made Titanic is heading to New York. Jack Dawson (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio) is the lucky tramp who won tickets with his friend to go onto Titanic. While touring the boat and meeting new friends he sees engaged Rose Dewitt Bukater (the gorgeous Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kate Winslet). Jack and Rose form a very close friendship, which obviously becomes more. Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) is the nasty guy who is wanting to marry Rose.

","The movie of Titanic came out in 1997. And then was an Oscar award winning. The director is James Cameron. And the actors is Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as Rose. This movie is love story. The Titanic was a ship that sank in 1992. It reorganize show film. When play ""My heart will go on"" song that will impress the movie, and then the love feeling. 3 hours long time, and then my watching is very romantic every plots, what is follow next plot. For example, Rose was flying in ships beside, that audiences were touched my heart by this shot. And then the scenery of breaking dawn is beautiful and wonderful. Every girl want instead of Rose that is romantic plot. Second, the passengers confused around the ship after the Titan crashed iceberg, unless musicians played on ""Wedding Dance"" so quiet. The shot was satirized by this gimmick point.Discussing technology, the titanic used model ship, which have shoot really effect. The passengers fall down and slide on the floor after the titanic was sinking in the ocean. The technology is very amazing in 1997, that isn't easy play on video. So, the video is a big making that appreciate the director designing, and then the plot had a nervous environment.The movie is my favorite. Jack and Rose is excellent, and then bring me have a romantic feeling. It was complete the end from embark to accident, let's me watching Titanic event.

","3000 men worked for two years to build the most gigantic ship of all time,The Titanic,the ship which couldn't sink. 2208 bid farewell to southampton in april 1912.Little did they know that this unsinkable ship was going to sink on its maiden voyage itself. Tragedy struck,1503 people died leaving the whole world shell- shocked. Good story for a movie,right? So James Cameron decided to do it.Years of obsession,research,plotting and 200 million USD went into making this film making it the costliest and the riskiest film of all time. The result? Titanic became the highest grossing movie ever and is still the 2nd highest grosssing film of all time,only 2nd to james cameron's own avatar. What makes the film so special? Its the way it unfolds,the way it is engineered by cameron. The writing,special effects are beyond brilliant,the fictional part of the film has become iconic,everything clicks. When the movie starts,during 1st few seconds,the background music plays and right there you know that this film is going to be special,it goes on for more than 3 hours and in those 3 hours,we are told the great story of the titanic. We get to experience the splendour of the ship,know the perspective of ALL the characters and that in my opinion is where the film wins. Cameron lets us to see the things from every character's perspective,be it jack,fabrizio,rose,her mother,her fiancé,her fiance's right hand,the captain,the passengers,EVERYONE. We see how they see things and it is amazing. The tragedy is shown in perhaps the best possible way.The thrill,the tension,the fascination,the grandeur,the love,the tragedy,in these 200 minutes,we experience it all. Kudos to Cameron for making this unforgettable and immortal piece of cinema which will be watched and loved by generations to come. From a guy who has seen the whole film in excess of 130 times and is still in awe of this magical story,here's a piece of advise- watch this film now if u haven't.

24 October 1998,Hippie69,," Flashy visuals and tired cliches galore
","Universal acclaim. Top grossing film of all time. Winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. What can I say about this monster of a movie that has not already been said? How about, ""It didn't float my boat"". After months of procrastinating, I finally went for broke and sat down to view James Cameron's Titanic. I knew what to expect, after all, this is the only movie I've been hearing people talk about for the past six months. Here is my impression of this film. It's a mixture of a Jane Austen novel, a Disney animated feature, and The Poseidon Adventure rolled up into one nice $200 million package. What do I mean by a Disney movie? Well, as I was sitting there watching Leo DiCaprio savor Kate Winslet's delicate touch, I thought to myself, ""Where have I seen this before?"". The answer: The plot is almost identical to that in Disney's Aladdin. You know the one: A beautiful rich girl is bored with her aristocratic lifestyle and longs to have some fun. She is supposed to marry a wealthy fellow, which her parents are pushing her to do. Then she meets a poor fellow, and grows to love him. The poor lad shows her a good time like her rich lifestyle never could. But what about her rich fiancee? What's a girl to do? Sounds like Aladdin doesn't it? And George of the Jungle. And countless sitcom episodes. Even Wayne's World made fun of it. And that is one of the twelve or so original movie plots which have been used over and over through the years. And once again, James Cameron recycles it, but this time he puts the story on a really big boat, and gives it a tragic ending to try to squeeze every last tear out of the audience. I've never really been impressed with Cameron's writing, and after seeing Titanic, I'm still not. I can't say much for the acting either. Billy Zane is just too ""Aren't I evil?!"" to be taken seriously. However, the good thing about this film is the technical expertise of James Cameron. The ship-sinking portion of the film is fabulous, from a technical perspective. Give Jim Cameron a camera and a few hundred million dollars and he can cook up a really great looking product. Just be sure to get someone else to write the script. I still insist that Contact, Boogie Nights and The Apostle are the best films of 1997. Titanic does not even come close.

And the artificial love story does not help down this horse pill of a movie. The music is the only thing that I enjoyed, but even that wore out its welcome near the last hour of the film. Cameron should've sunk this film before it came out and robbed people of 1.8 billion hard-earned dollars. I'm sorry to myself for seeing this film because everyone else was, and I'm sorry to everyone else who saw this embracement for this reason.

","I had the misfortune to be taken to see this film and spent an agonising three hours with the will to live seeping away from me all the time, so what's wrong with it? DeCaprio, from a purely unbiased mans view I can see the appeal to the more uncritical female section of the audience, however he was totally acted off the screen by the glorious Kate Winslet. This is not the first time consistently he is given parts that most actors would kill for only to find himself completely upstaged by much better actors, remember Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, Daniel Day Lewis in that abomination Gangs of New York. I rest my case. The soundtrack by Celine Dion left me with the urge to scream with tedium, good voice shame about the material! The film is over long and I can not see the necessity for the length the plot certainly didn't present any challenges or surprises. The Titanic disaster in reality was about people and peoples responses differed to the in relation to it, it was not only the rich who were cowardly and oppressive in reality there was a lot of bravery shown as well, in other words HUMANITY at its best and worst. I found the Hollywood gross oversimplification at best insulting at worst the stereotype portrayed about the Irish deeply insulting and approaching racist. In summation I would say that the experience was something similar to visiting a slightly dementing older relative and being left alone in their company for a day. The relationship between DiCaprio and The glorious Winslet (OK I'm Biased) could not carry the entire film especially given its length. I ended up praying for the iceberg and virtually cheering when DiCaprio sank without a trace.

","Titanic. One word I am sick to death of hearing. Jim Cameron, who has the biggest ego on the face of the earth, has only done three good films as far as I'm concerned, and they are The Terminator, The Abyss and True Lies. I would add Strange Days, but he had a small part of it. Back to Titanic. Why is this movie so talked about and loved? I'm sure it's the mass hysteria over Leo Dicrappio's cute little girly face that charmed female teen audiences, or Kate Winslet's breast shots. First off, I did not care for any character on this boat. None. Zilch. So, therefore, I was relieved when the ship sank and the heartless, snobs drowned. Note to movie makers: If you're going to make a film like this, give the characters some depth, and life, instead of flashing their cute smiles and snobby attitudes, and then maybe you'll have a halfway decent movie. Secondly, why was Boogie Nights shunned, when it was a far superior film than this. And why wasn't Russell Crowe nominated for Best Actor, and why oh why did this win so many Oscars? I'm crying now. This is a travesty on movie goers everywhere. They expect someone like me, who thinks he has some sort of brain to swallow this garbage? It makes me look like a fool to watch it. It also has come to my attention that since this is the biggest film of all time (puh-lease), that everyone is trying to milk it for every penny. Titanic t-shirts, jewelry, puzzles, novelty items, you name it, it's being done. I could go on and on about this, but I won't. So to sum it all up, I hate this movie. I hate it. I hate everything about it. I detest it. I despise every single thing about it.  I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate this movie!

","Well, 15 years after first seeing this at a second run-dollar theatre that I worked at when I was living in Jacksonville, FL, I finally decided to watch Titanic again in 3-D at the place my movie cinema-working friend is now employed at. Once again, we experienced the romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as the latter wants to escape the more controlling Billy Zane. Despite the dialogue between them verging on the melodramatic, director James Cameron also thought up some truly witty lines that especially suited Kathy Bates as the Unsinkable Molly Brown. And, yes, it's still very touching seeing Jack and Rose willing to stay together during all that chaos as the title ship keeps sinking. And how cool is it seeing Golden Age veteran Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose recounting how it was during Titanic's only voyage. And not to mention James Horner's iconic score. And while I thought Celine Dion's Oscar-winning song ""My Heart Will Go On"" was overplayed on Top 40 radio stations then, I actually enjoyed hearing it again during the end credits (though we only stayed through the cast list). And of course, Cameron keeps things exciting enough during the climatic sinking though sometimes I thought he piled it a bit much when he showed a young boy crying just standing there as Jack and Rose were running (it felt a little more contrived than usual though I realized such a scene could have really taken place). In summation, James Cameron's Titanic is still a very entertaining picture worthy of its Oscar status enhanced a bit by the 3-D experience though it wasn't really necessary IMHO.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am simply amazed that such a popular, beloved, critically and audience acclaimed film favorite as ""Titanic"" could sink so unseemly in the minds of so many who shelled out heavy sums of money and lauded it heavily at the time of its tremendous popularity. While ""Titanic"" is hardly as fresh, riveting, and entertaining as it was when I first viewed it several years ago, it still certainly retains a special distinction in the realm of cinema, at least in my assessment. Perhaps the screenplay is overly blase, full of clichés, and historical blunders, and the spectacle and sheer horror of seeing hundreds plummet to the bottom of the Atlantic is not as harrowing as it seemed in theaters, yet ""Titanic"" is still a fine, worthy, and sensational cinematic triumph. ""Titanic""'s technical aspects: its impeccable mix of sound and visual effects, dramatic and potent musical score (detract the obsolete ""My Heart Will Go On""), ingenious costume design, absorbing cinematography, and of course the gorgeous, stupendous design of the ship, still stand well above many efforts in cinematic history today, and are plenty appreciated and admired. The romance between Rose and Jack is perhaps the most cliché and nauseating aspect of the film, which, despite the film's perception as being ""extremely overrated"" might be ""Titanic""'s primary detractor, and that would be fully understandable- if these same critics weren't the ones who rushed to the cinemas to embrace the romance in the film! Overall, ""Titanic"" is a leviathon of a film: boasting popularity and critical acclaim and some really brilliant cinematic aspects, where it somewhat lacks in the script and the romance.

Street urchin is properly glorified and the betrothed vilified), and the acting was subpar (the only character I actually liked was the ship's designer). That leaves this movie with what every other James Cameron flick has: special effects. Unfortunately, they're not great enough to redeem the three hours plus this movie takes to endure.

When I first saw the movie I thought it would be a load of crap... boy was I wrong I was so entranced into the love story that I totally forgot that this was TITANIC so when the iceberg showed up I found myself sort of praying against all logic that somehow titanic would miss the iceberg, I even remember leaning to one side of my seat thinking if I did this the ship would miss lol. and of course when tragedy struck and the ship was sinking I was really caring for Jack,Rose and all the other passengers and even then I kept thinking maybe it will stop sinking and these poor people wont have to die. Throughout the rest of the film I was in complete utter shock I don't even think I blinked. even when Jack died I was in disbelief and in my head I was screaming along with rose for jack to wake up. The only time I cried in the film was at the very end of the movie when you see the titanic morphing into a new and pristine state and you see all the passengers inside greeting rose as she comes in then Jack extends his hand to her and they share a passionate kiss and everyones clapping, I was uncontrollable and the tears just kept coming.

","I held off on viewing Titanic until it was let out on tape. I had heard horror stories from friends and colleagues. They spoke of oceans of tearfilled faces and groups of 12 year old girls singing along with that god-awful Celine Dion song. So I dodged the theaters until a friend bought the tape. Out of morbid curiosity to see this ""epic"" film, I borrowed the tape, and sat down to watch it with her. My lord, it was the LONGEST freakin' piece of schlock I have ever seen. As my friend began to sob after the death of Leonardo, I got about as emotional as I do when I watch those AT&T long-distance commercials. You know, the ones where a little boy in L.A. talks to his daddy who is on a business trip in New York. And the boy always tells his father, ""I love you, daddy."", then the music cues to pictures of the teary-eyed father. Well, I saw a parallel between the commerical and movie Titanic. Both are contrived, blatantly staged, and chocked full of cardboard characters. The film was a filthy attempt to contort and force the emotions of the lowest common denominator. An striking example of this film's attempt to grab people and literally wrench the tears out of them come with the scene where the frozen, dead mother cradles her frozen child in her arms. Had this scene been in any fillm where the emotions were not completely artificial, I would have cried. But the fact is that this film was devoid of any real, heart-felt emotion. So when I saw this scene, I felt nauseous and grew full of spite. I now loathe Cameron for his utterly plastic,  inhumane protrayal of the Titanic disaster. Yet it appears he tapped a class of people bountiful enough to garner Titanic in excess of 600 million dollars in the states alone. I never knew America was so replete with people of such bad taste, people who would not only like, but view repeatedly this sad excuse for cinema. I weeped after seeing Titanic, but not do to its shoddy screenplay or horrifically unrealistic acting and emotions. I weeped for America, and the death of American filmmaking. I weeped knowing that such a film could garner accolades and billions of dollars, and that this bounty would push studios to make bigger films with smaller characters, crappy scripts and pretty faces devoid of ability that would pack seats no matter the quality of the film. (Here comes the TITANIC melodrama.) I could see a future where Coppola, Kubrick, and Malick stood on the gallows, pleading to the masses, now anesthetised and made prostrate by Springer and the numerous Titanic sequels. The directors voiced there thoughts on the death of intellect in America, then the masses let them hang as they chanted ""Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!""",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

",James Cameron's masterpiece a movie that has Almost everything in it love romance Heroism and sacrifice and unbridled Evil. And the best part most of it is true. Cameron's Titanic is a fictional story told from the most part between two tragic lovers Rose Dewitt and Jack Dawson. Winslet and Decaprio deliver career making performances here. I had been impressed with Decaprio from What's eating Gilbert Grape and discovered this young man can act He stole a movie from Johnny Depp not a easy thing to do. But anyways. Rose is going to be forced into a loveless marriage to a heartless millionaire wonderfully played in a sleazy manner by Billy Zane. Rose's Mother was once married to a man who was once Rich but spent all the money and Died on them leaving them only a name some social connections and a mountain of debt. So Rose must marry a detestable man for his money. In fact once they reach America they will be married. Jack Dawson is a drifter and a dreamer who goes where the wind blows him and the wind gives him a ticket to the third class passenger section of Titanic. Jack is a artist who cares for the adventure of life. Things happen when he rescues Rose from a suicide attempt and she introduces him to her world and discovers they will not make a place for Jack in their world he is beneath them. Jack introduces her to his world and she discovers people who are dirt poor but Rich in other ways They are so alive and vibrant and she discovers within herself the strength to move beyond matters of wealth and social standing. However Rose's Mother and her groom to be have discovered that Rose has fallen for Jack and all their planning in now in danger. Then comes the unthinkable the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to flood. The Captain is given the dire news in an hour all of this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. the news is met with horror skeptics scoff at the idea of the unsinkable Titanic sinking and the people are now drawn into battles of classes first class passengers first all others after. Jack and Rose struggle to survive the death of Titanic and to try to find some meaning after the ship has died and gone down to the bottom of the ocean. There is a beginning story that frames the entire movie involving men and women diving on Titanic looking for treasure and getting involved with old Rose who tells the story. But the Real story here is Cameron's dedication to detail he spent fives years diving on the Titanic and interviewing survivors his quest for accuracy was an obsession that paid off Big. I took my wife to see this movie back when it had just been released and I groaned thru the romance and I laughed at the end when Dicaprio's Heroic Jack Dawson makes a big sacrifice in fact my wife called me a caveman with no feelings. However 13 years later I saw the film on TV again and watched it from the beginning and I Caught all of it. And I understood it better now that all the hype has died down and the Cult of Decaprio has quietly gone away that this movie is a human tragedy and that love knows no boundaries and that somethings should always be remembered no matter how painful.

Here's the bottom line: the love story and acting were pretty good, the special effects were stunning, but the film's main problem is that it was at least 30 minutes too long. The first part of the movie was straight-forward and the acting was decent, and yes, I'm not afraid to admit it, but Leonardo Dicaprio did a good job. However, I'm a big fan of action/thriller movies, and the second half of Titanic could have been much better. For one, there were too many scenes of unimportant people falling this way and that and dying. If they focused more on the main characters, that would cut off some extra running time. Also, I'm not too sure that a disaster thriller and a romance story can mix into an overall product. You know the boat is gonna sink, so why throw in a whole different second storyline?

I picked a seat up front (even though I prefer to sit a bit farther back), and I got ready to view the film. The lights dimmed and the entire room fell silent. I remember that at the beginning of the film, I was slightly bored. The opening few scenes were different than most movies I had watched back then. But, as the film went on, I grew more and more excited to see what would happen next and I actually became invested deeply into the story. The intense ending with the ship sinking was scary - yet epic! And, when the movie came to a close I was thrilled. I had enjoyed it more than I ever thought I possibly would. I decided to buy it on VHS a few months later, and I played it for my (then teenage) kids. They loved it as well.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2001,c.huddle-lamb,10," 6 critical reasons why this was an excellent film
","Less mystifying than the success of this film is the negative response it received from most critics. It has been labelled a spectacle of death, adolescent, banal, and (most damning of all) Hollywood. (Hollywood's become an adjective now, apparently.) At least five of my friends would not see it because Leonardo diCaprio is a teen idol, and they feel above associating with that kind of thing. The dialogue is pitched at a very general level - the last thing you'd call it is poetic. I think part of what rubbed so many critics the wrong way, is that this is a completely new approach to the Victorian romance. (I know, 1912 isn't precisely Victorian, but it's close, and as the 'Edwardian romance' isn't really a genre, that's what people will be comparing this with.) Room With A View this ain't. It is, however, reminiscent in many respects with Thomas Hardy's novels. Here are some of it's features:",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

Its tragic sinking will always be remembered, for the ship went down on the first voyage with heavy losses. The director of the film is James Cameron. The main parts in the film are played by young actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet. To my mind their acting is superb. The camerawork is fantastic, too. I've heard that they made a full-size model of the ""Titanic"" for this film. It's a very spectacular film. It is also a moving love-story. I advise all my friends to see ""Titanic"".

","Okay, everyone knows what happens in ""Titanic"", so I'll discuss a few other points. While the movie was in the theaters, one of my friends went to see it 13 times, just so that he could find goofs; the one that he picked up on was when someone opens a door, turns his head, and you see that it's the wrong color. When I took a sailing class in summer, 2005, the teacher explained why specifically the Titanic sank: it was traveling way too fast for something that size (so they couldn't turn in time), and the metal on the ship's sides was rather shoddy; that is to say, they endangered everyone's lives so as to save money for themselves (well, that's one of many times when those at the top have put profits ahead of safety). And I have a question: considering how many people died on the Titanic, was it appropriate to use this event to further Leonardo DiCaprio's career? As for that story that I wrote, it portrayed Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck (from ""In & Out"") believing themselves to resemble Leo and Kate; Al Pacino (from ""Donnie Brasco) realizing that he was going to sleep with the fishes; Jim Carrey (from ""Liar Liar"") admitting: ""I can't lie: I wasn't watching for icebergs while I was steering!""; Kim Basinger (from ""LA Confidential"") wondering whether or not she would look like Veronica Lake at the bottom of the ocean; and Jack Nicholson (from ""As Good as It Gets"") still inside his cabin and saying ""Don't knock on my door!

","James Camerons, Titanic is a film that everyone knows about and one that every movie fan will have to watch at some point and it's worth such praise as I found this to be a fantastic film with one of the best romances ever put to screen. By far the most admirable thing about this movie is the fact that it never drags despite being over three hours long that because they use every scene to fullest to either increase the chemistry between Jack and Rose or to get attached to the characters you know are doomed. The title ship looks incredible in this movie everything from the lower cabins to the luxurious cigar rooms look nothing less than life like. This first and foremost is a love story and that works for this movie it helps to give the eventual tragedy more weight to it and there's not a single second where you don't believe either of these to people aren't in love. You just feel like they belong with each other and need each other and it takes two exceptional performances to capture that. Leonardo DiCaprio is just perfect casting in this films he's incredibly likable and entertaining and hate to see him trampled over by the first class passengers. Kate Winslet though gave the best performance in this film you feel that despite the fact that she has infinite riches she feels completely alone and she portrays that perfectly and her final scenes with Jack are absolutely heartbreaking to watch. The final hour of Titanic is centred around the sinking of the ship and never have Tension and Desperation been captured quite like this every single scene brings a new obstacle or challenge and just gradually seeing the water rise adds to the tension all the more. There's a lot of scenes in this film where characters are only looking out for themselves and are leaving others behind to die but you don't hate them for it (except Cal) you understand their desperation and will to survive and the viewer has to face the fact that they would likely to things very similar in the same situation. This is however not a perfect movie it does have some flaws, for one a lot of the side characters, specifically the first class passengers, just have nothing to them their just their to be hate able and to give more obstacles for Jack and Rose to cross and more could have been done with them. I also think that their was no need to focus so much on the present day storyline it takes up to much time toward the beginning and should have kept all these scenes until the ending of the film and could've still had the same impact.

","As a lifelong holder of minority opinions, much of my time is spent baffled in wonderment as to how a seemly intelligent person could've paid good money to go see ""The English Patient"" twice during its original run. Or says ""Love Story"" is the greatest romantic movie ever made. Or who prefers the original ""Ocean's Eleven"" to the remake. And one of the biggest thorns in my side about movies is this piece of garbage which trivializes the catastrophe that was the sinking of the Titanic by making it a turbulent backdrop for a badly-derived Romeo and Juliet ripoff. Pretty boy Pauper sees Rich kid Rosie (or whatever her name was) and goes, ""Dude, I have GOT to tap dat!"" With a little help from Kathy Bates, he convinces her to slum it with him in the steam room in perhaps the most gratuitous sex scene that made lonely women go ""Ohhhh..."" in years. Then the boat sinks. Several thousand people die, but the REAL victim (says Cameron) is the girl because she must live on with the memory of that blond piece of ass she shagged on the boat. I think what pisses me off most about this movie (besides the fact that if the girl had scooted over on that bit of wood a little bit, she could've shared it with the man she supposedly loved. Or they could've taken turns in the water, but God forbid she get her dress wet) is the fact that the story really had nothing to do with the boat. They could've made up a fictional boat crash and it not only would've been more appropriate, but it would've made more sense. And that Celine Dion song?

","James Cameron's Titanic is proof that a movie doesn't have to be original to be good. I'm not saying that originality is bad; I like it, it's good, but it's a minor factor in how good a movie/story is. The story doesn't necessarily have to be original, but it has to be compelling to people; has to capture the emotion and interest of the audience and keep them riveted throughout. Titanic does just that. It captures the heart and interest of the viewer and keeps it completely riveted all the way through the end (it did for many people, anyway, including me).",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

I don't mean that in a bad way, but it was too slow, and was jammed with special effects, the story line was horrible, and stupid.  The whole love story is so predictable.  Not to mention the story sucked even more because you knew the ship was gonna go down and the only thing holding the story together were the special effects.

He should stick with what he made famous, and that is the sci-fi/action genre. Titanic is such a sugar-coated load of crap...not only is it painful on the eyes, it is painful on the ears with that godawful song by Celine Dione. At over 3 hours, it is simply gruelling to watch. Leo DiCaprio is a terrible actor who looked about 5 or 6 years younger than he actuall is. Kate Winslet is talented, but this talent is wasted. The movie doesnt know whether it wants to be a teenie-bopper chick flick or an action movie, and the bizarre transition from one to another is even worse. I have watched many movies that top the 3 hour mark that I have thoroughly enjoyed (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Terminator 2) but these movies use the length to benefit the story, while Titanic simply uses it as an excuse for more explosions, more soggy dialog and an excuse for Winslet to get naked. I am not bias to the love story genre, but this just takes it to a new level of badness. How it won best picture is beyond me. 4/10 stars (I admit I have seen worse)",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

My favorite part was the process of the sinking of the Titanic, it was really interesting and educational, but also suspenseful and sad.

What he didn't need to do, however, was make Jack die since he was a main character.    If I produced this movie, I would have made Cal freeze to death instead and Jack would marry Rose.  The present time would have both Jack and Rose as an elderly couple talking about what had happened.  Another thing that bothers me is how these third class passengers were treated.  The crewmen wouldn't allow them to go up to the deck until all the first and second class people were loaded onto the lifeboats.   After breaking down the door, the third class passengers fled to the deck.  Some of them, however, gave up and stayed down in the steerage.  The scene where the Irish mother is telling her children a story to put them to sleep is very sad.  I really hated Rose's mother Ruth.  She was very nasty and shallow.  The ship is sinking, many people are dying, and all she cares about is that the lifeboats are seated according to class?  What a b****!

How about his moment of silence for those who perished on the Titanic? Perhaps Cameron felt obligated to acknowledge the dead since he was making millions dramatizing their tragedy. Perhaps he was being sincere in his sympathies. I don't know. What I do know is that it was one of the most cringe-worthy moments in Academy history. But Cameron doesn't stop there; he simply cannot leave good-enough alone, so he continues to babble on incessantly as his head continues to expand.

Sadly it stayed in my city for only 2 weeks and I could see it only today-- I had to go to a city 2 hours away from mine to catch this. In the first scenes I could see some cheesy lines and overacting-- mainly from DiCrapio and Paxton. After the first hour, the cheesy lines became less aggressive and I could stop remembering all the time that it is just a movie. The story is so well done that you feel inside the ship. They made a 3 hours plot so interesting and entertaining that you feel the movie just ended too fast. The relationship between the main couple-- although repeating the same old formula from Romeo and Juliet-- seems so realistic that we get jealous and want to have the same feeling they have. Unfortunately, it's not that easy to find someone you truly like in real life. One remarkable quote is when Jack says ""Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me""; you see, Jack was suffering with cold and about to die, but he still thought that dying would be worth it after the strong love they had-- which is, in my opinion, one of the most emotional lines in cinema history. Special effects are also quite good, some scenes are IMPOSSIBLE to explain how they've been built-- 3D or not. The story is all completely sad and painful to imagine, and you'll probably be very sad after seeing the whole picture, but will make you cherish your life even more.

","Titanic is a marvellous, expansive film with the first rate special effects you expect from James Cameron, lending the feeling of vastness and realism you would feel. Lead acting performances are uniformly well done, though the dialogue they have to work with is disappointing. The film is hampered by an unimaginative screenplay, with trite dialogue and poor situations. But the film starts of well enough. The first one half or two hours are enthralling and even breezy, doing well to hide the films poor writing, and are a joy to watch. After this however, the tender love story which has played out is replaced with frantic, frenzy action for the next hour or so. This is the section after the ship strikes the iceberg, as the film attempts to, like a typical Hollywood film, milk every single situation and obstacle they can. This, rather than being suspenseful, just felt boring, languid, and contrived. Thankfully, the film reverts to tenderness in the last 20 minutes, with jack and rose on a piece of wood and the famous ending. The problematic bits of the film are hence those where Jack and rose are engaged in action rather than romance. Hence, I think the movie is overlong, and should've been trimmed down at the parts mentioned.

Who gives James Cameron the right to romanticize a terrible accident that took the life of a thousand people? Sure, the movie shows us how cruel the reality is. But the movie seems to tell us that Titanic and it's sinking are nothing compared to the sad and once-in-a-lifetime-lovestory.

7 October 2014,cornellthorn,10," A Fantastic Movie
","I never thought that a ship wreck would be able to produce such an amazing, and romantic movie. James Cameron did an amazing job at synchronizing a horrific event in history with the everlasting love between Jack Dawson and Rose Bukater, who was played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Titanic is a movie that keeps you on your toes whether it's between the two love interests or between the tragic events that is happening to the ship, and the people while the boat plunges into the water. To me Titanic is a five out of five movie because of the amazing actors/actresses, the story line, the message it relays at the end, and all the different characters that made this movie so diverse. While watching Titanic you have no choice but to fall in love with the characters which made me want to watch the movie even more. The actors/actresses were amazing when portraying the characters they were supposed to be. The way they fell into character so easily was elegant. The director made the characters so diverse, which made it more interesting to see how different classes of people were treated back in 1979. The people that were chosen to portray the characters actually looked as if they were born for that particular role. You could feel the sincere emotions the actors were giving off while in character which made the audience open up to the movie. The movie was so interesting that the audience could watch the movie over and over again and it will never get tiresome. A contributing factor to success of Titanic was how the movie told the background of some of the characters. They were able to tell the story behind most of the cast members like the husband, mother, newlywed couple, and the young unfortunate families. Some of the characters in the movie might have not been intended to be significant, but ended up being very important to the impact the movie had on the audience's emotions. For example while the boat is sinking there is a mother who is tucking her kids away into their beds. She felt like that was the only choice she had, because she knows that with their social status they would have no chance of survival. All she wanted to do was comfort her kids and make sure they were at ease right before they all perish. Just that scene alone played an important role in the audience reaction and emotions. The movie also relayed a very unique personal message that was very meaningful. The Director showed that love can conquer anything, and can last forever even throughout death. In the beginning of Titanic we noticed that the very first time Jack saw Rose he instantly fell in love. Through the entire movie the audience see how their connection grows into this deep love that neither one of them have ever experienced. Rose was engaged to one of the wealthiest men on the boat, and she gave it all away because of the connection her and jack shared. Even when the ship was sinking Jack and Rose was so passionately in love they literally did anything for each other. For example, Rose went into the bottom of the boat, which was filled with water, to rescue jack, who was handcuff to a pipe and left to drown. Also, Rose jumped off one of the only life boats in order to stay with jack cause she knew that she couldn't go on without him, or how Jack let rose lay on floating wood in order for her to stay out the freezing water and stay alive. All of those contributing factors made the movie great. I fell in love with Titanic and will recommend the movie to anyone. After watching this movie it became a part of history and any and every one would love watching it. When watching the movie you fall in love with the message that the movie gives you. The characters that are being portrayed make you fall in love with the movie as well. This movie makes you want to watch over and over and anyone would love it.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","Boy do i hate this movie.  I'm so happy this isn't in the imdb's top 250. I'm a little angry it isn't in the bottom 250, it should be. This movie is more predictable than the alphabet.  For those people who haven't seen it, God Bless You.  Please don't see it.  If you see it, it will be a greater tragedy than the sinking of the Titanic.  Let me give you an example of how long and boring it is.  If you stare at a clock tick down for 24 hours it will fell shorter than watching this movie.  The lines are such a joke, let me express myself on a couple.  ""I'm flying"" - Kate Winslet.  If i was beside her at that moment, i would pick her up and throw her overboard and my line would be ""no your not.""  Than the movie would end and it would save everybody sitting in the audience a lot of time.  Another garbage line was ""you jump, i jump"" - Kate Winslet.  I could have done alot with that moment, more than James Cameron that's for sure.  I would have made them both jump off the boat and get eaten by Jaws (wow what an ending!).  That would also save some time.  The soundtrack was one of the worst i ever had.  It is a shame the great James Horner didn't win an oscar for Braveheart but won one for this movie.  Celine Dion still has the most annoying song i will ever hear the rest of my life.  Every time i saw her video i wanted to drop kick my television set, in hopes i might actually hit her, and shut her up.  I am very happy this film won no acting awards, that is the only justice the Academy Awards handed out that year.  I was so happy when the stupid row boat sank.

","In general I am not keen on large budget spectacular productions such as ""Titanic"".

Seldom does the excessive expenditure lead to a better script, better acting, better direction or better photography, and these are what govern the quality of the final product. Titanic won an incredible number of Oscars, which are supposed to be completely independent awards (11 in all I believe). At the time I cynically took the view that the need for these Oscars as a bait for attracting large audiences had led to extensive funding of media promotions designed to ensure that this particular film was in the mind of all the judges when the selections were actually being made. I also remember feeling very upset that several superb performances in lesser low budget films made during the same year appeared to be being squeezed out by all this hoop-la. Nevertheless once all these awards had been made, I had sufficient faith in the Academy Award system to assume that there must indeed be something totally exceptional about this movie, and I made a mental note that I should see it at some future time.

For ""Titanic"", however, writer-director James Cameron has chosen to embellish the facts with a predictable and cliched romance, in which Kate Winslet's feisty, intelligent (and way too modern) heroine overcomes the stupidities and rigidities of her privileged background to learn about herself and life through the love of Leonardo diCaprio.  Boy-man diCaprio appears hopelessly miscast, playing a ""man of the world"" in the fashion of the lead in a high school rom-com.  In fact, his role is a pretty straight reprise of his Romeo in Baz Luhrmann's brilliant Shakespeare adaptation - but whereas the whole of that film was imaginatively conceived so that this character worked in that role, in Titanic he is desperately unconvincing in a piece of social commentary that prefers corn to meat at every opportunity.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

Watching this story unfold after about a year reminds one of what a cinematic masterpiece it is. Cameron has used many of the tried and true movie conventions to great effect.  Slow motion enhances the lovers' flight through the engine rooms, using the glow of the furnaces to foreshadow the romantic scene to come and the ensuing tragic events.  Instead of constantly bombarding the viewer with a blaring soundtrack, in the sequence just before the ship finally sinks, the director uses the spare violins playing  `Near My God to Thee' as the Captain, the architect and other characters near their approaching doom. The sound design also includes some extremely effective use of surround sound as Rose (Kate Winslet) searches the bowels of the ship for Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio).

The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d**n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either.

And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!!

I think the strong romance actually works and makes the audience care more about what happens to them, and of course, to the ship. This is a very sad story - as you might guess. The scenes after the ship hits the iceberg and everything goes haywire are shot with cinematic excellence. I believe this movie still remains to be the highest grossing films of all time and most number of Oscars earned.

30 June 2001,teejayniles2345,9," ""Inspired"" by historical events but not constrained
","This blockbuster is a milestone in film making and a career peak for Director/Producer James Cameron.  When this film bowled over the competition (except in acting and writing categories) at the Academy Awards,  it could be the occasion of a gleeful self-coronation (Mr. Cameron as ""King of the World"").  It had set box office records and was probably also record-breaking for multiple ticket purchases by teen fans of such a long epic.  Like its ""older sister"" GONE WITH THE WIND, this Best Picture Oscar-winner exists in a self-enclosed quasi-historical environment where the beautiful survive and thrive despite morally despicable transgressions. It claims to be ""inspired"" by actual events around the sinking and recent re-discovery at ocean's bottom. Those who love TITANIC feel that the mismatched couple outdo ""Romeo & Juliet"" as a most appealing ""eternal"" couple.  Teen fans of Leonardo DiCaprio would gladly throw caution to the wind as did the lead actress who poses nude quite immodestly.  As an unimpressed but still positive-minded fan of this movie overall, however, I have loads of questions to ask those who defend this as ""one of the all-time best movies"" (A.F.I. put it in the category of MOST THRILLING in its 2001 list recently).  For example, shouldn't a more specific disclaimer be attached to the closing credit acknowledgments about the ship's crew and captain who are ""transformed"" unnecessarily and untruthfully into brutish villains? Since real names of actual dead are attached to some ""inspired"" crew and passengers, attentive audience members assume that those historical people who deserve blame (like Bruce Ismay) are those who did kill and threaten others and otherwise act like the most wicked people ever.  Too many names can be exonerated and should be since this script took liberties with depicting the desperate, final actions of the crew.  As a second example, why doesn't Molly Brown get her lifeboat over to help those floating in life-jackets (in regular history, this IS (!) part of her claim to fame)?  Furthermore, what happened to Fabrizio in the film's middle?  How is it that the 100+ year-old is unsupervised at film's end?  Does the special effects wizardry paper over and rationalize the simplistic ""chase"" elements of the film's quite long middle?  I felt a bit confused whether the drowned victims were mostly ""caged in"" by the class-bigots among the fictional crew ""stewards"" or if they were just too slow in figuring out a strategy like the romantic couple had as the Titanic goes down for the third time.  Any help on these issues, Mr. Cameron and defenders of his script?  I didn't expect to know if time ""stood still"" when the ship takes on water but the film takes the ""worst spin"" on how the lifeboats get loaded and away in time to save only 1/3 of those aboard.  Were these numbers strictly correct? The facts could have been a little better adhered to, in my opinion.

I must admit that even though I never actually sat down and watched the thing from beginning to end, but I work at a video store and I was forced to watch the second tape of the movie for well over 28 days in a row. (The 1st tape was not viewed so as not to offend any customers during the scene where we were all forced to see Kate Winslet's endowments.)  Needless to say, when we finally were allowed to remove the now wasted tape from the VCR, I took the tape outside and promptly ran over it with my car.  It felt so good. With that one action I hoped to rid myself of this terrible viral infection brought on by watching this movie too many times. I hated the film although I had never really ""seen"" it.  I had bought a copy of the film before the 28-day onslaught but hadn't opened it yet, so I decidedly took it back to work with me and traded it for a DVD copy of another movie.

The movie is phenomenal. There's a group of a research ship in 1996 or 1997 exploring the wreck of the Titanic and one who is obsessed with finding a diamond that was worn by someone on the ship. They recover a safe that they think it might be in. It isn't in there but there is a picture of a girl wearing a necklace with the diamond and this is shown on the news. The girl in the picture, named Rose, sees it, recognizes herself, and calls them and tells them the girl in the picture is her. They have her come there and she tells a story of being on the Titanic and the movie switches to the day the Titanic left on the trip where it sunk. It goes back and forth from 1912 to 1996 or 1997. The 1912 part focuses on Rose and a boy named Jack who, out of luck in a game, was able to get a ticket to the Titanic.

Since the ending is already known without having to view it even once,  I am curious to know what drew so many people to see it numerous times.  The story-line was sometimes no better than one of those nickel romance books and perhaps that was what drew the audience it did?  There was nothing spectacular about the acting; on the contrary, I found all of the performances, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, quite uninspired and boring.

The story jumps from the predictable stuff (you know the ship sinks, that never changes) to the heart and soul of characters that have no idea of their future, for good or bad. All starts with a simple drawing, and from that simplicity we move to jaw-dropping chases in the guts of the ship, hear-breaking love moments and many extras falling. The rhythm is a little bit slow in the first two acts, but from the moment the iceberg and the ice enter in scene, wow, here is Mr Aliens again. Kate Winslet moves from classic first class lady to Lt Ripley's daughter, the ship of dreams turns into the bath of nightmares, the history accuracy fights against Cameron's Machiavellian film making, and at the end, you just cry in joy, sadness and suffering. The best sequence of all this? The ship splitting is awesome, but Nearer my God to thee is a heart-touching, tear-jerking, whimper moment, with that Irish mother cuddling her children before die, the Captain facing his destiny and the band playing to the very end.

If there was another person who can share the credit would be James Horner. The music comes alive with the sea parting for the ocean liner. The initial departing scene in Southhamton and the the working of the engines with the sound of the pistons going fullboard ""Let us strech our legs Mr. Murdoch"" is just awesome scenes to reckon with. The sea is alive with the sound of Titanic. The scene with Rose shivering on the plank of wood is probably the weakest part of Cameron's directorial brilliance. The scene is short and plastic.

21 May 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," A sinking feeling.
","'Titanic (1997)' is bogged down by arguably unnecessary modern day sequences, its run-time sailing well beyond the time it actually took for its eponymous ship to sink. These opening and closing moments are what started Cameron's seemingly unending obsession with deep-sea documentation and, in some ways, seem a little too indulgent. However, they do add a layer of theming to the thing and sort of explain the director's motives in making a massively budgeted, romantically focused epic out of one of the most well-known tragedies of the twentieth century. Once the piece progresses into its bulk, it starts to become a lot more interesting. The film revels in its splendid set-design and CG-enhanced environments, marvelling at its own ability to aptly convey the period and paying immense attention to even the smallest of details (though it's apparently content with 'filling in the gaps' any way it pleases). At times, the picture feels rather self-congratulatory, to be honest. However, this confidence is mostly well-placed; the movie did, after all, make over a billion dollars. Just because it made money doesn't mean it's automatically good, though. It's undeniably messy and slow, somewhat confused as to whether it wants to be a straight-forward historical tragedy or an alternate-history 'against all odds' romance (and that's not even mentioning the reflexive, somewhat self-aware vibes of the modern day stuff). Having said that, it's effective on more than one occasion. Some of the romantic banter between its leads is charming, as is their overall relationship, and the 'clash of the classes' angle is generic but enjoyable. Any time DiCaprio and Winslet share the screen, the film is fairly entertaining. However, it doesn't get properly gripping until the DVD asks you to change disks halfway through. This latter half is dedicated, almost entirely, to the sinking of the ship. This is a well-known fact and, frankly, a key selling point of the picture, so it isn't exactly a surprise. Yet, the extended sequence does a good job of maintaining tension by introducing mini conflicts which don't have a pre-determined end. This segment contains some visually spectacular stuff, as water floods corridors or crushes characters against gates and the whole ship turns on its side as it sinks to the depths below. Thankfully, this stuff isn't beautiful; it's devastating. Some of it is really suspenseful, too. It's the most successful aspect of the piece, for sure - although it does feature a shot that demonstrates literally the worst 'face replacement' I've ever seen. When it comes down to it, the flick isn't as impactful as it should have been. It struggles to balance its two major elements, feels unnecessarily long and is often somewhat self-indulgent (and, thus, rather dull). It is, however, a visually spectacular and occasionally charming experience with a highly effective final third. It's long and uneven, but it's probably worth a go if you're a fan of DiCaprio, Winslet, Cameron or, somewhat strangely, historical tragedies. 6/10",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

Boy meets girl, girl already engaged or to be engaged with a fatal divide, in R+J it's the family divide (Montigues and Capulets), in titanic it is the barrier between the rich and the poor, the only reason this desecration of Shakespeares work (Romeo and Juliet + Boat) sold is because it had special effects involving the sinking of the liner 'The Titanic', THAT was it's USP, what else is there? The story? Already covered that. The acting? Hell no. A girl in one of my classes at college was praising the writer on such an imaginative story: "" How did he come up with the idea of creating this story of a large ship sinking AND adding love."" Now don't get me wrong, I wouldn't base this review on one silly girls remark, but if you reverse that, there was no creativity in it, the only creativity involved was part of the tarnishing of the past of REAL people who were on the boat, the man who shot himself for killing a passenger, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! He gave his life to save others... Where is the conscience of the Hollywood pigs who tainted this guys past?

25 February 2003,Sunshine14clr,," beautiful love story!
","i love this movie. this movie was one my favorites along with many other friends of mine. we would watch it over and over. hehe. i have always liked leonardo dicaprio. he is a great actor and has great looks. he plays handsome jack dawson, a poor artistic american who travels all around the world. he wins his ticket on titanic at a lucky game of poker along with his italian friend fabrizo. he seems to care very much about people and their feelings. despite all of cal's money and power, he could never measure up to someone like jack dawson. the prideful cal realizes his competition with jack even in the beginning. he thinks how could someone as wealthy and powerful as him lose a woman's heart to a 3rd class passenge? the answer is love. he meets the beautiful rose, a 1st class passenger about to be wed to the wealthy but evil cal hockley. it was an arranged marriage made by rose's money hungry mother who doesn't ever seem to consider what rose wants or how she feels. her mother and fiancee seem to have absolute control over her. this pushes her even closer to the edge. the two meet out of fate. jack reaches out to rose and he ends up falling in love with her. as does rose. rose is left with the decision as whether she should stay loyal to the evil cal and her mother. people seem to complain that this movie has way to much romance and not enough action. it has plenty of action. a movie like this can really open up your emotions. i don't see anything wrong with adding a little romance. some of the characters are ficticous obviously but it still includes history on famous passengers; thomas andrews, bruce ismay, margaret ""molly"" brown or the ""unsinkable"" molly brown, john jacob astor, captain e.j. smith, 1st officer merdock and many others. obviously they're all 1st class passengers merely famous for their money. a lot of the movie centres around 1st class and 3rd class. i didn't see anything on 2nd class though. to this day the movie still makes me cry. it would be nice if all men were like jack dawson and no men like cal hockley. hehe. well if you like romances/thrillers and want a good cry i reccomend titanic to you. 10 stars out of 10! hats of to james cameron!",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2010,Ziya90,5," As a romance, it is simple, as a disaster movie, it is underwhelming
","Let's start with James Cameron. He made the greatest action movie ever made and also one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, The Terminator 2 Judgment Day. The Terminator was excellent too, but 2 surpassed even that. By only these two movies, he has become one of the greatest directors of all time, don't you agree? However, it was really weird that he wanted to make such a movie. Thus, Titanic does not look like a James Cameron movie at all and additionally it is lack of creativity, James Cameron creativity. You know, by considering The Terminator movies, you can see how a creative director James Cameron is. Titanic is an ordinary movie, a simple movie on all counts. Everything is simple that I will mention later. At that time, Leonardo Di Caprio was at the top, the beloved of teenage girls, in fact, young or not, females were admirers of him. I like Di Caprio and he is still liked, may be even more because of the performances he gave in his recent movies, but what I am trying to say is that I try to find out the reasons, why a lot of people love the movie and it broke a record at the box office, became the most watched film of all time? It was owing to Di Caprio? Well, I don't think so, I mean not only owing to him which is sad. Because as said the movie is simple on all counts. As for Kate Winslett, as an actress, she is one of my favorite actresses ever, I just love her, but players cannot save a movie, this is what I believe. The love story is simple. Let me summarize it one more time. A poor boy. A rich girl. And the rich (and black hearted) fiancée of that girl. The family of the girl want their daughter marry him, but she is not sure. Then, the poor boy and the girl meet and fall in love with each other. See? You know, James Cameron is rather an action (and science fiction) director, isn't he? and this is a disaster movie besides romance, isn't it? but this side of the matter, action, excitement are simple either. You expect the same masterful, perfectionist and creative level for Titanic, but it is not. I did not get satisfy on this count, because Cameron does not focus on disaster, he focuses on romance and this is weird. This is a three hours movie, but the disaster side of it is unsatisfying. Therefore, the people who had expected an exciting, suspenseful disaster movie disappoint like me. As for the Oscar issue, yes it broke a record in the Oscar history too, 11 Oscars! To me, there are two wrong decisions in the Oscar history. One is Titanic's 11 Oscar winning, the other is Shakespeare in Love won the best picture Oscar instead of Saving Private Ryan. I should confess that the other was much more painful, because if you ask me, to give the best picture Oscar to Shakespeare in Love while one of the other nominees is Saving Private Ryan is something like to give the best picture Oscar to The Notebook while one of the other nominees is 12 Angry Men. Returning to Titanic, the love story in it is not heavy or dull at all like Shakespeare in Love by the way which is good news and despite I am not female, it was real touching and at the end, my ears filled with tears. However, unfortunately these do not make the movie great. Let's talk about the branches which Titanic won Oscar. By the way, as for entertainment, yes I was entertained, but not very much. The best editing. Well, this is not Memento or Amores Perros, the editing was 'normal' in this one. The best cinematography. If it is one of the bests, then what is Amelie then for example or Across the Universe? The best costume design. What were the costumes, daily life costumes? Yes. Titanic was not a period movie exactly wasn't it? Even if it was, the costumes were ordinary, daily life costumes. The best art direction. Again, Titanic is 'normal' on this count. Amelie, 2001, Batman, these are the examples come to my mind now. If we talk about the themes of the movie, it is seen that they are simple either as everything else.

","Let me explain by picking this flick apart.  Beginning: good, established the ""characters"" nicely, set a decent pace.  It's all downhill from there, folks!  Leonardo DiCaprio's performance could only be described as a poor imitation of a twelve year old doing a poor imitation of Clark Gable (he should at least be happy that I said they're names in the same sentence), and Kate Winslet was either too subdued or, well, way too subdued.  Don't get me wrong, the beautiful costumes and lavvish sets were awe-inspiring. I do admire James Cameron's attention to detail.  I also admire James Cameron's ability to direct an exciting action/adventure film, and therein lies the heart of the problem: this is not an action /adventure film. When the boat was sinking it played more like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Hypothermia than a tragedy of epic proportions, and the fact that the two leads didn't seem scared during the whole ordeal didn't help matters much.

Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack.

This movie is not insanely clever. It is not particularly intellectual. It certainly is not modest and yes it is embarrassingly commercial and almost prides itself for being 'Hollywood junk'.

Whilst the talent gathered (Winslet, Zane) hinted at true acting ability (they have provided far better performances in other films), the script is lacking in anything other than schoolgirl Mills and Boon. The technical effects have obviously been done to high standards, as the boat looks impressive, but that is where it ends, as the man-child DiCaprio slaughters the basest of emotional lines, as makes the romance seem cliched and below par.

It was probably as simple as it gets. I also hate how farfetched the plot was. If Cameron had done ANY research prior to writing it, he would have realized how a romance like that would have NEVER happened. During 1910's American & England people married and dated within their economic class.

","Banal, crass, slushy, unoriginal, expensive, only won 11 Oscars as a `thank you' because if it had flopped the entire Hollywood studio system would have collapsed etc etc Yes all of these charges were and still are being laid against James Cameron's hugely expensive, multi Oscar winning epic. Times (and critics for that matter) never change because that is exactly the sort of thing people were saying back in the 50s and 60s with epics like Ben-Hur and look were they are in the cinema cannon. Having said that it is ironic then, Titanic is the sort of film people say they don't make anymore. It is true that some of Cameron's dialogue is not exactly Shakespeare, but everything else in the film more than makes up for it. DiCaprio and Winslet are perfect as the lovers crossing the class divide and bland lines aside Cameron's story is cleverly structured in developing the love story. From the dinner scene as Wisconsin boy DiCaprio holds his own against the snobs he's sitting with, to the detailing of the sinking itself. Cameron as director triumphs totally. At three hours long, the film feels more like 90 minutes, the recreation of the Titanic, both afloat and going under is brilliant, spectacular and thrilling. Cameron coaxes superb performances from his cast, with Zane the stand out among the supporting players as a nicely nasty villain and James Horner's beautiful music score enhances the mood of the film perfectly. Titanic hits all the emotional targets with more inspiration that is common among today's big budget films and the amount of effort that has gone into it, from the acting and not just the production is there for all to see.

This was not meant to be a documentary. It was meant to be a fictional story set against the historically accurate background of the Titanic. Some people have tried to say that the movie was not accurate like Walter Lord's book. I have read the book, and Cameron must have memorized it to match the details so well. Besides, Lord wasn't even entirely accurate. His first book had the ship going down in one piece. Well, to all the critics of Titanic, I have this to say: If you want to go raise $200 million and make your own version of Titanic, you can do it however you want to.

Secondly, perhaps it was just my eyes, but everything seemed brand new on the set. I realize that the Titanic was a new ship, but even at the beginning of the movie, the place where Jack was playing cards, his clothes, etc. all seemed impeccably clean.

After the first hour I could (and almost did) fall asleep, wake up an hour later and not have missed anything. The movie drags on forever...in the end, I was left wondering how the movie could be so popular. I honestly didn't find it emotionally-moving at all.

","Perfect in practically every way, and probably my favorite romance (aside from CASABLANCA (10/10)). the 3+ hour length did not bother me. The ship itself, of course, is gorgeous and the score is excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio, who never had impressed me much before, was quite good, but not nearly as good as Kate Winslet, who I feel deserved the Best Actress Oscar (although I love Helen Hunt dearly). Victor Garber, who played the builder/designer of the Titanic, is excellent, although under-used and under-appreciated. Gloria Stuart is great in her supporting role, but not as good as the incredible Kathy Bates as the ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, my favorite character.

","Director James Cameron reportedly said he wanted a Hollywood veteran to play the role of Old Rose, whose character is aged 102 and a still-living survivor of the Titanic at the time of an undersea search.  And a veteran he found in Gloria Stuart, Hollywood star of the 1930s and 1940s, and 87 years of age when the film was shot.  Old Rose slowly tells her story and spins her way into the hearts of millions on every continent where this film has played.  Eleven Oscars this film took home among fourteen nominations garnered (and most were deserved), but the greatest among the three missing statues on Oscar night was Gloria Stuart's.  Without her this film was an f/x extravaganza with a serious lack of credibility.  Di Caprio and Winslet simply aren't Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh and probably won't grow up to approach anywhere even close to the likes of them, either.  Nevertheless, Cameron wanted a film that the world would remember and he got one -- that ship was as real as anything yet created out of thin air.  Loudest applause for him and the massive crew that made this film possible, and for Gloria Stuart who made the story credible.  Top rating (5 stars of 5) !",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

After watching it for 3 times already in my life, i still can't believe i've seen a gigantic ship sinking in a film, with such an incredible realism. I heard there were used some test puppets to make it look like people were falling off the ship, well i haven't noticed any, everything looked so real, all the people that were falling and screaming for help. The fictional story about the 2 main characters, falling in love, is genially directed, some of the scenes are very touching, very well filmed.

Him and Kate Winslet both did a great job, there's no doubt about their acting skills whatsoever.

","The special effects of this film are some of the best I have seen in a movie. The great Titanic slipping under the waves, the people staying aboard for as long as they can, the individual stories of the famous people that were really on the ship (Molly Brown for example), The Capitans refusal to slow the ship down due to iceberg warnings and so on. Most of us know the story of the great liner that sank on that cold April night. Taken as that alone James Cameron's film is a masterpiece. You really feel like you are on the real Titanic with the people of the time. The problem I have with this film is Leonardo DiCaprio. Say what you want but I feel he was mis-cast. He does not even try to act in a way you would expect a man of 1912 to act with his squeaky voice, saying things like horse-^*@% and I know how the world works. In other words he acts like he just came from a day at the beach. Kate Winslet is better in her role as Rose Bukater but I would have preferred a different actress. She plays the part mostly as someone who needs to grow up. The love affair between the two main characters is not believable and serves only as a distraction. Granted just showing the history of the famous ship with the people who were really there would have been boring for most young viewers without some modern story they could relate to. In this case a cheesy love story. Aside from that this film pretty much works. I watched it for the story of the Titanic and the actions of the crew that night, and the mistakes that were made that lead up to the disaster. Cameron crafted this part of the film so you felt that you were really there. Jack Dawson and Rose Bukater seemed out of place....",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'll start by saying Titanic was in no means a bad movie but I thought there were way to many flaws in this film to be Oscar worthy... In my opinion Kate Winslet was far from her best when it came to acting in this movie. She said Jack's name ( Leonardo Dicaprio) way to much like everyone watching would forget it or something it was really annoying. I also found later on when there running from that guy who was like Billy Zanes Characters assistant or w.e and after they loose him later on they go back up and he plants the heart of the sea diamond on Jack and the fact Rose believed he stole it after willing to leave her life for him just really bother me because if it was true love she would of trusted her so called love of her life!! That made me real annoyed also. Then when the ship is sinking and she finds out its a lie and goes after him, Rose and Jack go all the way back up from the basement of the ship and find a life boat but they wouldn't let Jack on and he tells her he will find away which he probably would since his character is pretty savvy but instead she jumps back on to the sinking boat, Like what the heck! Now that made me mad...Finally the last thing that no movie has made me feel such anger and disgust was the scene when there in the water and Rose is on that door and poor Jack is in the water shivery his butt off after all he did for her and instead of switching or taking turns she just hogs the whole door till he's dead.

","I have read a great many of the comments posted regarding ""Titanic"". Needless to say, I've come face to face with platitudes of spiteful criticism. The film's detractors seem to be beating the same arguments into the ground: length, DiCaprio, special fx, Cameron's ego, cliche'd dialogue. Not to say that these are all valid points (to a degree), but arguing the film's cliche'd machinations is essentially becoming a cliche within itself. Moreover, I notice a steadily- increasing lack of originality in the complaints; words like ""awful"" and ""stupid"" and all sorts of loaded language season every dissenting word. I have yet to see a concise, beautifully-articulated dissent, one that can explain contempt towards the film in a meaningful, intelligent manner. Allow me to conclude with three final points: (1) to dismiss the film as an overblown love story would be a pompous, arrogant thing to do; a disservice to the tragedy that the fictional tale is centered around; (2) James Cameron may be a lot of things, but he is not, by any shape or form, a bad director -- he's a competent technocratic director, not yet in the same league as Spielberg and Lucas, but he weaves tales that emphasize human emotion above human ingenuity, and he does it in a way that puts the likes of Bay, Bruckheimer, Emmerich and Devlin to shame, and; (3) Titanic is not ""the most overblown, over-rated film of all time"" - that title goes to Larry Clark's ""Kids"".",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2022,DemurraNasty,10," Phenomenal success
","According to the press, Cameron got the idea for the picture after watching a documentary by James Ballard from the National Geographic series, filmed in 1987 and telling about a trip to a liner resting on the ocean floor. However, before the realization of the idea, the eminent director-screenwriter created not only the ""Abyss"", where the action takes place under water, but also the expensive futuristic action movie ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", only after that he managed to convince the management of two majors, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures, to agree to mind-blowing costs (eventually the budget was a record $ 200 million), which predicted a grand catastrophe in advance. But Cameron still did not back down and, moreover, remained faithful to the initially chosen course: that is why the main action is framed in ""Titanic"" by a prologue and an epilogue telling about a group of researchers trying to find out at least some details of the crash. However, the secret of the phenomenal success of the film without exaggeration around the world (the total box office totaled over $ 1.8 billion, of which only $ 600 million was in North America) lies in something else. Unlike the creators of almost all previous versions, Cameron outlined the story taking into account the rather strict requirements of what is commonly called - certainly with capital letters! - Big Hollywood Style. His brainchild can be considered a contribution of overseas cinematographers of the end of the XX century to that glorious tradition, with which, first of all, the products of the ""factory of stars"" were associated in the minds of the mass audience throughout the century. ""Titanic"" fits perfectly into the typological series, including such names as ""The Birth of a Nation"", ""Ben Hur"" (even two versions, the 20s and 50s), ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""The Sound of Music"". On the one hand, the story is again based on a genuine event - and a significant, even fateful event. The author not only reproduces the circumstances of the tragedy in the most detailed way, but interprets it in a symbolic way as an ominous warning to humanity - a warning about those global cataclysms of a political, social, man-made and natural nature that soon hit the Earth. The dramatically increased possibilities of cinema allowed the audience to assess the true scale of what happened, to feel to the depths of the soul and clearly see what the iron tread of History is. However, on the other hand, making a reservation just in case, the director-screenwriter introduces a fictional character (Cameron insisted on the candidacy of DiCaprio, then little-known), who turns out to be the main character of the entire romantic line, where fantasy, again according to custom, is not at all obliged to obey the facts. ""Titanic"", therefore, does not seem to be an innovative work, which, perhaps, it did not pretend to be. But Cameron cannot but be grateful for the contribution that he has made to the growth of the popularity of cinema all over the planet.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 1998,jmcgraw7,," Not perfect but highly entertaining
","In some ways I can understand why some people hated this movie. I agree that it's overhyped and did not deserve either Best Picture or Best Actress. The love story was cliched and lame. Dicaprio's acting has seen better days (check out Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape for a true picture of his talents) though this wasn't really his fault, but Cameron's rather badly written script. And the script? Well--what can I say? It's really an action picture, after all. Some important details leading to the sinking were glossed over or totally ignored, such as the wireless operator's role in the tragedy, the Californian ignoring pleas for help, etc. However, the movie  is already quite long and in order to fit the love story in and develop the characters enough for us to care, much needed to be left on the cutting-room floor. Personally I don't have a problem with this. Documentaries and more historically realistic films about the Titanic have already been made. This is meant to be a Hollywood *movie*, not a documentary or even good art. Cameron never leads us to believe that he's trying to make it anything more than it is, and for what it is, Cameron's Titanic is an excellent movie. The only real problems I had was the under-development of certain characters, namely Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews. Both these characters were far more interesting in their small roles than the two leads, and it's too bad Cameron chose not to expand their roles even if it meant a *four-hour* movie. I would have gladly sat the extra hour. The other problem is the two leads. As I already said, Dicaprio may have been miscast, but his character was so inherently uninteresting and ""perfect"" that I doubt *anyone* could have done a better job. He did look weird next to the voluptuous Winslet, however. Someone with a bit more meat on their bones, perhaps, who looked slightly older? I don't know... As for Winslet, well, she's a good actress but Oscar material? Hmmmm. She seemed just a tad too, um, cheap and klutzy to pull off the role of a first-class young woman with any believability. A more refined and ethereal actress such as Claire Danes would have been a better choice. Also, these characters's speech seemed too ""modern"" for 1912...but I could be wrong here. As for the SFX, absolutely stunning and totally believable. I really felt what it must feel like to be on a sinking ship. The sequence with the band playing on as people either race about panicking or calmly succumb to their fate is extremely moving and made me cry more than anything Winslet or Dicaprio did. This, and the scene where the camera pulls back to show us thousands of people thrashing about in the freezing water (chilling in more ways than one!) are perhaps the best in the movie. Horner's soundtrack is moving and perfect, though I could have done without the dumb and overplayed Celine Dion song during the closing credits. Best of 1997? Maybe not, but definitely up there with my favorites.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hi, my name is Slim and I just saw a movie that cost enough to keep me and all my inbred cousins supplied with hooch and chips until the next millennium. We are talking big bucks here, so many millions that it makes even me drool. And here's the kicker: the plot of the movie can be summed up in about a dozen words. Poor boy and rich girl meet. They fall in love. Ship sinks. Some folks say there's all this other stuff about man vs. nature and man and technology and man and the haves and haves not, but all that stuff is about 15 minutes out of the 3 1/2 hours the film takes. So it doesn't really count. You know by now I'm talking about Titanic, made by the same guy who gave us the greatest Arnold Schwarzenegger flick ever made, Terminator, by James Cameron. Well, this time around Jimmy boy decides to make a movie where everyone knows the ending, so he can use all his creative juices and tons of dollars from who knows where to build a 3/4 size replica of the ship. None of those miniatures for Jimmy boy, oh no he wants the real thing. So we got lots of nice shots of the ship sailing in the ocean, shots from above and to the side and above and from the side and oh hell you've seen one you've seen them all. Too bad whenever the shots go into the ship and onto the ship and show what is going on you realize you've seen all that before also. As I said, everyone knows what happens to the ship. And to most of the people on it. Not much suspense here. We got rich folks strolling about, with the women wearing these hats that could be used as landing fields for seagulls; we got teeming masses of humanity dancing and drowning, but not at the same time; we got lust and the two backed beast between the poor boy and rich girl; we got lots of people going swimming against there wishes in the dark and cold ocean; we got the star of the show sinking and sinking and sinking, but being brought back to life by the wonders of modern day technology.

","I just finished watching this on TV. It's easy to see why this movie was initially overhyped and overrated, then trashed as nothing more than a pre-teen chick flick. In truth, it's a lot like ""Dances with Wolves"", a big screen three hour plus epic that grabbed a fistful of Oscars, then p***ed everyone off by beating out what many thought was a superior film (for ""Titanic"" it was ""LA Confidential"", for ""Wolves"" it was ""Goodfellas""). I don't know if it was Oscar material, but it was definitely better than the critics now claim. On the plus side, no expense was spared in getting every detail visually perfect. I don't know how he did it, but James Cameron managed to thoroughly convince his audience that it was the real Titanic we were seeing. And the sinking scenes were amazingly real, enough to grab the heart of the most jaded movie goer. On the minus side, far too much time was spent on the fictional romance between Jack and Rose. The story of the Titanic itself contains so much drama that wasting two hours on this love affair was simply not needed.

","I rented this a while ago with very high expectations. After all, it is the highest grossing movie of all time (as of the time of this writing). I was left pretty disappointed. That's not saying the movie is without its perks. The special effects are breathtaking. You can tell that lots of time, money, effort, and care were put into creating them. The special effects are about all there is to the movie. The story really isn't too bad, but how many ways can you tell the same story? A rich girl meets a poor boy and fall in love. Her parents disapprove. Not really ground-breaking. The story has been told better many times before. The acting is pretty mediocre. Leonardo is definitely just there for his looks. If they had casted a good, but not as attractive an actor, would the movie have grossed as much as it did? I think not. I know about twenty girls who saw the movie fifty times each to see Leo's face. Kate Winslet isn't as bad, and the remaining actors do fairly well. It's just no surprise this didn't win any awards for acting. Length is also a problem. If the movie were half as long, I'd like it more. The boat sinks for over an hour! It looks good, but it could have easily been cut down. As Kevin Murphy might say, ""It's like they have two servings of tension and they're stretching it out for seven people"". It just strikes me kind of funny that the ""Best film ever made"" failed to win academy awards for best actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, OR screenplay. On the whole, there are worse ways to spend your time, but the best film of 1997 should have been won by ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""As Good As it Gets"" instead of this.

James Cameron proved to everyone just how bad a director can take something when his ego gets in the way. There is no ONE good thing about this. Unecessary sex, bad cast, annoying special effects, and no boat! This was clearly Cameron's vision as he knew that if he did not sell out, he would have the biggest bomb in his laps. There were so many historical inaccuracies that I lost interest within 1 hour. Needless to day, I wish I could have those 3 hours back. The film attempts to cross modern survivor recalls past theme. It doesn't work. The movie was not art in anyway. When a director is spending 200 million, I have a right to expect a little more than a love story that is a) historically impossible(upper class NEVER married nor dated lower) and b) horrible acting. To this junk get all those Oscars is a crime. How could something like this win over Gandhi and The Last Emperor. Those are art films that didnt need a huge budget.

","In the past, I was unable to comprehend Jack; I always assumed that he was a romantic lad with liberal ideas who enjoyed leading an unrestrained life. The maxim ""To make each day count"" appealed to me because I desired adventure and independence. There is no purpose in focusing only on love because life is harsh and not a haven for those looking for pleasure. Thinking back on the entire movie, Jack's words and deeds eventually made it clear to me that he is the one who knows the most about love and life. He was the one who taught Rose how to love and live her life to the fullest. In addition to being Rose's lover, Jack Dawson served as her spiritual supporter. He cared for her until she was grey and helped her recall when she was unable to walk anymore: ""There was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me in every way that a person can be saved.""",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

They were fantastic in the 'Romeo/Juliet', star-crossed lovers type. There's been several comments regarding the scene towards the end where Kate (Rose) is seen on a wardrobe (with room for Leonardo) (Jack) to be saved with her. I guess the script didn't call for Titanic Pt 2 because, had it, no doubt Jack too would've survived. Billy Zane didn't disappoint as the villain. I didn't cry but I was moved by the reality of the sinking. It must've been truly horrific knowing there was so many who perished in this sinking. I have since found whenever I see a photo of the Titanic, I can actually hear the screams of despair. I saw 'Raise The Titanic', no way is it comparable to this movie. Raise The Titanic had many people believe she sunk intact, when, in fact, she was literally torn apart and crumbled as she sank.

Rose: ""Oh Jack, (insert melodramatic line)"". Jack: Oh Rose, (insert melodramatic response)"". Other that that, I have very little bad to say about this. Cameron builds the tension between the characters and the ship beautifully and by the time Titanic's doom is approaching faster and faster, the film turns into a very ""beautiful"" survival story. The part when the ship breaks in two is especially dramatic. One more thing, Cameron is known for his larger that life action movies, and it is obvious that this time around he's tried something else.

","Having been a fanatic of the Titanic story for as long as I can remember I was tickled with anticipation when I heard Titanic was coming to the big screen.When I finally got to see it in December of 1997 I wasn't disappointed.James Cameron did an incredible job in recreating this story down to the finest detail.Casting only people who physically resembled the original passengers and crew was a risky move(could they act?)but it paid off.His attention to detail was incredible.Even the napkins on the dining tables were monogrammed with the White Star Lines insignia.The scene on the boatdeck where a young boy is spinning a top while his Father looks on is taken from an actual photograph taken by a passenger.The scene where Captain Smith is discussing lighting the last four boilers with Bruce Ismay and in the background are two women passengers sipping on lemon tea,it is based on the original event-there really were two women sitting behind the Captain and Ismay on that day in 1912,they survived to tell the story. The movie does have rather banal dialogue in parts,but this is it's only failing.It's three hour running time seems to fly by and the scenes of the sinking were nothing less than spectacular.The scene where Officer Moody shoots himself after shooting two third class passengers made me wince a bit though.This scene is based on conjecture,there is no real evidence that it actually happened.Personally,after years of researching the story,I think he may have fired his pistol,but into the air,not at passengers.I guess Cameron added it in to create more intensity,but really,there was enough going on as it was. To me,the romantic storyline between Leonardo Dicaprio(originally Cameron wanted Brad Pitt) and Kate Winslet is secondary to the spectacle of the actual Titanic story.They do have a chemistry,and their courtship was plausible,and it certainly helped the tears flow at the end of what was an already sad story.Not to be emotionally moved by the films last half an hour would take a stout heart indeed. It is truly a tear-jerker. This film only really works though on a big screen(no less than 29"")and with digital surround sound.I have watched it on a 21"" tv without Dolby sound and the effect is flat. James Horners score is perfect for this movie and comes in at just the right places.My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion was a risk that paid off dividends for Cameron who originally didn't want vocals in any of the films soundtrack,he wanted the music to speak for itself.It would have been a lesser film without it.

","Right off the bat, I'd like to say that in general, I think that three hour long movies have a tendency to repeat certain parts of its plot over and over to reach its intended length( See, The Thin Red Line) However, Titanic's producer and director James Cameron managed to do a noteworthy job of avoiding this snag. Unfortunately he made a bad movie in the process. Kate Winslet did a formidable job, excuse the phrase, of trying to keep Titanic afloat. Her efforts were hampered by her thoroughly unbelievable lover Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). His ""poor boy"" image was hampered by his less-than-rugged good looks. For a troubled kid who is supposed to lead a rough life, he hardly looks the part. Hollywood's traditional technique of making a male look more 'rough around the edges' (smearing a little mud on their cheeks and tussling the hair) fails miserably on DiCaprio, mainly due to his flawless face and hair. After two minutes of standing in the mist of the bow of the Titanic, he looks frustratingly like the Leo we see walking around town. The film tends to drag on when it could have been accomplished in little over two hours. By the time the film is over, the fact that the movie is longer than it took the actual boat to sink seems much more believable.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

I seem to remember lengthy movies like ""Ben Hur"", ""Ryan's Daughter"" or of course ""Gone With The Wind"" coming with an intermission roughly halfway through but there's no such break here as Cameron knows that by the time the water starts to pour into the stricken ship, no one will want to leave their seat.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

This budding romance never rang true; thus, I found it exceedingly difficult to become emotionally involved when their inevitable demise was at hand.

I'm not going to dispute anyone on the plot, the filming of the movie was excellent, costume design did a great job and despite several factual errors, I can see why so many liked it, but to call it the greatest motion picture of all time blew me away.  The requirements of the greatest movie of all time has to have some influence on society, become a part of our culture, even impact those who have never see it on top of being a GREAT movie.

For a movie to be considered the greatest, it has to be accepted on all levels, by all audiences, young and old, male and female.  There are a lot of great movies out there, Titanic even being one, but Lucas has set the standard for the greatest movie with the Star Wars Trilogy.

","I can't for the life of me figure out why James Cameron spent so much on Titanic.  Okay, the effects, very lavish and spectacular but everything else was, how can I put this politely, REUSED.  Has anyone else seen 'A Night to Remember'?  Well, apparently James Cameron has, he recycled the entire movie and decorated it with a few pretty faces and called it Titanic.  Or how about that wonderful score by James Horner? Didn't we hear the same stuff for BRAVEHEART.  Don't get me wrong I like Horner but, he's only written three soundtracks in his life, he just recycles them to fit other movies. Winslet and DiCaprio got away with sleepwalking through this film, both are capable of a whole lot more but I won't deny them their moment in the sun. Don't get me wrong, I liked Titanic, it's an enjoyable movie but I think the praise is a little over the top.  Cameron is not fit to lace Steven Spielberg's boots when it comes to directing and it's tragic that in a world with Morgan Freeman that anyone with a brain can mention Leo as the best actor in the world.  .  .I'm talking to all you teenage girls out there!

I LOVE the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack & Kate Winslet's Rose (you just don't see romances like that anymore, which is a shame). I enjoy watching their romance grow until the very end. James Cameron was right in making sure that the audience gets an ""emotional doorway"", to use his words, to realize just how tragic the Titanic disaster really was by having them, as well as Jack & Rose, go through the events that led to the sinking . . . Did Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) ever do stuff like the things Jack did for Rose, risking his life because he loved her so much? I don't think so, because he didn't really care about her, or even love her for that matter . . . so Billy Zane did a fantastic job at portraying this character you just love to hate! All the other actors in this film, particularly Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Gloria Stuart, & Bill Paxton, did fabulous as well.

30 October 1998,Brutus-6,," Stunning, albeit overrated
","When I first saw this film, I left the theatre with a sense of awe, overwhelming sadness, and a deeper appreciation for the delicate position of human nature.  Like many people though, I was too quick to judge the greatness of this movie without weighing it objectively. Titanic is the work of a brilliant, gifted director who belongs in the halls of greatness with those of Welles, Hitchcock, Spielberg, Scorcese, and Coppola.  You could feel the sweat and blood that James Cameron devoted to this spectacular picture.  If Titanic deserved any Oscars, it was for Best Direction. I think that any award bestowed after that is riding the popularity wave. I think it deserved a nomination for Best Picture, and it probably was the best of those nominated, but the category itself was weak.  What happened to Amistad, or Contact?  Those movies both impressed more than Titanic.  I laughed when Kate Winslet was nominated.  For what talent?  I'm glad the Academy didn't get too carried away and nominate the entirely overrated Leonardo Dicaprio.  Gloria Stuart was a nice surprise, and she lost unfairly to Kim Basinger.  But so did everyone else in that category. True, it suffered from bad writing, but there's only so much you can write with the sinking of a ship looming over everyone. Many consider this the best ever -- those who do are either teenage girls and boys (whose appreciation for fine cinema doesn't extend beyond Grease) or past generation hermits who leave the house just for groceries and evening cribbage.  Anyone else who does need only sit and think about the ""greatness"" of Titanic for awhile.. but, still a movie worth treasuring and preserving forever.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

Although I agree with some of the reviews that the movie has its merits, some of the supporting roles and scenes are touching and the cinematography is pretty good, with a multi-billion dollar budget and three hour run time, a movie better be magnificent both in cinematography and story development. James Cameron spent way too much money, time and focus on making a grand picture and neglected characters and story development.

I thought it would be a good movie to watch with her, since its basically a chick flick, and she would be happy after the movie, and really happy with me for wanting to go with her, I just wanted to make her happy.

A movie theater in my area had it on until the day it came out on video.  Of course, I was going to be in line at Suncoast Pictures in my local Mall for my copy the day it came out but three days before it came out, I had to go back and see it on the big screen one more time because it was so impressive and so realistic.  I felt like I was there, really there.  This is definately one of my favorite movies!",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2014,FreddieDouglas,4," A massive bore
","Simply put, Titanic is one of the most overrated movies of all time, in terms of how much money it made, how many people seem to like it, and how many awards it won. While the performances from Dicaprio (playing Jack), Winslet (playing Rose) and other supporting roles like the ship Captain are solid, the film on a whole just isn't. To sum up the film in one word would be ""boring"" or ""generic"". Titanic does't become the disaster movie until the very end, up until that its an extremely generic ""poor-boy-meets-rich-girl"" love story, something thats been done a billion times before. The film is also filled with completely two dimensional characters which I guess I supposed to reflect the times, with the segregation between the rich and the poor. Even so, the characters such as the one played by Billy Zane as Rose's rich husband to be, are just lazily written with no character other than ""I'm-rich-and-I-hate-the-poor-toff-toff"". The film overall is just a bore, and gets only mildly interesting when the boat actually starts sinking. Absolutely nothing special about this film whatsoever. One of the most overrated movies of all time.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

So, I was interested when ""Titanic"" hit the screen. However, this film just didn't do it for me as a whole. I found the love story between Jack and Rose unconvincing.  I really found the whole character of Rose hard to take.  While recognizing that she was in a bad spot, she came off to me as so egocentric and petulant that there were times when I felt like she deserved Billy Zane (great as a nasty.  Billy Zane has the perfect looks for the early 20th century parts).  So when she hops in the sack with Jack, it looked like a nice fiery diversion that probably wouldn't have lasted two weeks once the boat docked.

","Over its three-hour runtime, Titanic represents a gigantic cinematic achievement. And while the first half takes on the responsibility of establishing the presence of all the faces that we will follow, their relationships and the tragedy that is announced, the second part is responsible for the definitive test of how much we have been involved up to that point and how far Cameron's heavy hand with his team was justified. The whole act of the ship succumbing after colliding with an iceberg takes about an hour or so of projection, and with all this time in hand, Cameron elaborates his opera of despair, tears and the true portrait of the dimension of the facts, of solidarity vs. Need for survival, greed vs man's unpreparedness and overconfidence. ""Not even God could sink that ship"", says someone at one point, and Cameron is keen to keep this line of dialogue as an uncomfortable irony about the representation of power that the Titanic gave to those responsible and how their fate symbolized their downfall. And how several lives had to pay together for it. Cameron does not make this explicit in dialogues, but through situations while the ship sinks that make it impossible for the public to remain impassive in the face of the fact that, yes, the fate of the RMS Titanic could have been different.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

Jack has nothing to offer Rose, and he knows it. That's all I can say without getting too detailed. Basically, every part of this film was wonderful. It was delicate and it was sad.

","There is a backlash brewing, especially amongst imdb fans who suddenly brought Titanic down from the #1 ranking to out of the top 250. Fine, you win. The film will just have to settle for the all time box office record and tied for the most Academy Awards. It is interesting that most of these Titanic haters did not see the film when it first came out, and didn't even see it in theatres at all. The longer you waited to see the film, the more difficult it would be to watch it objectively. Many of these Titanic haters never wanted to see the film to begin with and went out of their way to tear it down when given the opportunity to finally see it. Those of us like myself who saw the film in theatres during the early weeks were able to watch it more objectively. I expected it to be well directed and technically impressive. James Cameron directed The Terminator, the most intense and relentless thriller I have ever seen. Aliens redefined the sci fi/horror film. What I was not expecting was that I would be crying at the end of Titanic, the first film to make me cry since Ghost. As a man, one who loves Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, L.A. Confidential, etc., I was caught completely off guard and became very emotional during the last half hour of the film. I cannot explain it and don't want to explain it, but I will never forget this film because it somehow got these feelings outside of my otherwise stoic self. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart broke my heart, and James Horner's score perfectly set the mood for me. I paid to see the film several times (and sneaked in to see the ending many more times.)  The total amount of time and money I put into watching this film is a bargain compared to the many hours of therapy sessions I otherwise could have had. The feelings the film inspired in me (normally well hidden) has since enabled me to become a more open, emotional, giving, well rounded person. That is the highest praise I can say of this film.

Kate Winslet's Rose could have been like any rich person on the ship and Leo's character you don't have any record of just like you didn't have records of some of the real people that got on the ship by mugging passengers before they got on it.  So who cares if they are fake?  How dumb of an excuse is that to criticize this movie? ""Waste of 200 million""  yeah yeah right sure, not one of you could have come even close to making this the film it is.  ""Leo sucks""  now you are just full of jealousy and since Leo is an overrated actor (I admit that he is) that since he's in the movie you have to say it's horrible.  Well for those of you who actually think that he is like the same character he is in The Man in the Iron Mask why don't you actually watch this movie because those of you that have said why it sucks is because of Leo have obviously not seen it.  His acting and many others are great in the film, ok maybe not outstanding but nor were the ones in Gone With The Wind, you just make them out to be.

They are throughout the film but they are so clear you don't realize it.

It would have made an okay movie, but the cliche's were heavy enough to sink the ship even if it hadn't hit the iceberg. Chances are, the reason this film was so successful is because it crudely slams together all the various concepts that other successful films have used. They include #1: Romance between rich and poor, #2: Stuffy rich folk, happy, free poor folk. #3: An adventurer, world-travelling lead male character. #4: A husband-to-be for the main male character's romance, with a tendency to be abusive. #5: A historical setting. #6: The romance genre done very sappily. #7: Attempts at making the audience cry by showing scenes of various tragedy in case the sappy romance plot fails to make one cry, so that people will call it touching. The list goes on and on, but unlike so many others, I'm afraid I'll have to chuck this entire film and all it's content in the ""It's been done."" area.

","A 7.0? Are you kidding me? I have read all the comments on this movie and let me say, there is just absolutely no need for them. Isn't it funny how in the winter of 1997 everybody was going to see this movie, some multiple times, helping it become the highest-grossing movie ever and now they all hate it? I feel bad for Cameron, hopefully he never gets on this website and reads this crap, because he is very talented. Tell me what, exactly, is bad about this movie? Every single excuse I've heard for people hating it are biased opinions based on stupid things. They say they don't like it because of Leo. Okay, there are about a dozen other actors BESIDES Leo here. And he wasn't even that bad, come on, get a freakin' grip! A little note to people who get on here and TRY to be movie critics: you don't rate a movie on the likeability of an actor. That's a selfish OPINION. It's like saying ""I hate Pretty Woman because Julia Roberts wears a red dress and I hate red."" Please. Sure, I get the fact that the love story is somewhat cheesy. But that's only in certain parts of the movie and the movie is over 3 hours. Some more advice: don't rate a movie in pieces. Commenting on the beginning love story and the end with the sinking, what is that all about? A movie is one whole piece of work. How can you just show a ship sinking and not set it up first with a beginning? Everything about this film is spectacular. The music, the sets, the effects, the themes. It shows how Titanic not only changed the world, but the very lives of the people on it. If you'll notice at the end, none of the characters ever really recovered from it. The love story is essential to take you on the inside of the tragedy and see it how people that were actually there saw it. From a victim's eyes. And if you laughed at this movie, then your heart is as cold as the iceberg that sank this ship. Do you laugh when a bomb goes off, killing people? I hope not. 1500 people DIED on this ship, many suffering one of the most horrible deaths (drowning) and never even getting a chance to save themselves. Those that didn't drown were tortured by freezing to death. Stick your hands in ice water and tell me how you would feel being totally immersed in it, slowly dying. Children and babies died. Think about that and tell me how cruel someone has to be to laugh at that. Cameron makes you feel for the people on the ship, something other Titanic movies failed to do. By creating characters we care about and ripping them apart, he creates a true tragedy. It's not a comedy. The last hour is one of the most exhilarating movie experiences of all time. And so is this movie. This is possibly the only case in which a film once so popular will go down forever as being ""gay and a piece of trash.""

","This movie has ABSOULUTLY nothing to do with the real Titanic. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it made me cry thinking that I would never get my three hours back. I feel bad for wasting my time on this complete BORE of a film. It has too much romantic involvement,and the acting is awful. Compared to The Loin King (which was one of the BEST films I have had the pleasure of viewing) it would have kicked its sappy butt. Everyone likes that stupid love story? But what about those people who are SICK of hearing everyone yell, ""I'm king of the world!"" when really, you're just an idiot who got overpaid to die at the end. While so-and-so and whatshisface are running around making out with each other and drawing pictures in the nude, we wait and wait for a disaster to happen and finish off these two PATHEDIC excuses for characters. Then Celine Dion breaks through with the worst song ever, which makes you want to gouge your own eyes out and eat them. I danced around my living room after seeing whatshisface drown, which is the highlight of the entire crap-fest. In reality, this movie is for losers who have crap love lives who wish they could get on a ship and meet some guy who looks like Leonardo Dicaprio and enjoy bubble baths with Harliquin romance novels. If this movie was made today, it would bomb. Loin King (again, the best movie ever, I say this after watching them both-one after another) would've won the Oscar, and this would be what it is: A billion dollar waste. The members of the Academy must all be single mothers (who are on Prozac) and thirteen-year old girls, for this to win. All I can say is: America is a bunch of morons. This is the worst movie ever. DO NOT watch it, DO NOT waste your time and be like these people who love this movie. Pre-pubescent idiots. James Cameron ripped me off. Only because I liked Jerry McGuire. YOU RIPPED ME OFF, JAMES! I'M COMING FOR YOUR HIDE! ",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'd like to proudly join the ranks of the minority who found this film to be a tedious, silly, childish serving of ridiculous pap interesting only to juvenile sensibilities. Aside from the presence of the genuinely talented DiCaprio and some admittedly visually striking scenes of the boat's sinking, the film (as any film is) is absolutely mortally impaired by Cameron's Jack and Jill simple script of poor but good boy loves rich but trapped in evil high society girl who are then tragically parted by cruel fate while their love is still young, sweet and fresh. If only genuine real life were actually like this perhaps films like this could be enjoyable, but any sensitive, perceptive mature adult knows that (perhaps unfortunately) that it just ain't so. Cameron is certainly, though, an extremely talented action director with the directing credits of Aliens and Terminator 2 to his name, he just shouldn't write his own scripts as in this department his insight and understanding of the depth and complexity of the genuine human experience is seriously lacking.

","I know everyone is sick of reading about how the simple plot is wonderful and Kate and DiCaprio did a nice job with their roles.  Of course these are all true. However, no one has ventured to ask why this movie is the greatest of all time.  The key?  The haunting musical score of James Horner.  It takes all the effects and images and gives them meaning and emotion. Without his score (even John Williams probably could not have done it better), the movie would have lost a serious amount of the magic it held for me and the majority of the American public.  From the trademark flashback scene in the beginning to the life boats at the end, Horner's music captivated the emotions of the people and the tragedy of the shattering of a supposedly ""unsinkable era.""  Consequently, DONT buy the video unless you plan on buying a surround sound system.  You will not only be insulting Horner's phenomenal score but you will lose a lot of the emotional drive the film had in the theaters.",/review/rw0436929/?ref_=tt_urv

Titanic simply adopts this recipe and puts her on board an ocean liner (just like the Poseidon) where she presents us with the classic love triangle where tragedy will cut love at the finest thread. In all a declaration of principles it is easier to survive when you are rich and debauched than when you are poor and sensitive.

","The sinking of the Titantic is actually quite interesting, as anyone who has read a well-written book about the event can tell you. This film tosses away that story and replaces it with a cornball teeny bop-per love story that makes one want to puke, all the while slandering historical figures (like J Bruce Ismay, whom James Cameron has falsely portrayed as a prototypical heartless and cowardly businessman) and some others unfortunate enough to be a target of Cameron's biases. In the end, Cameron's film so far removed from reality that it's unlikely anything it contains would ever be taken seriously by anyone looking for the historical facts. I mean, when was the last time Hollywood presented real history? Probably 1964 when they filmed The Longest Day, whose script was religiously close to Cornelius Ryan's book. Since then, not much. The fact that Cameron had to make up a subplot wouldn't have been so bad, had it remained a subplot to the story of the sinking, and had it been realistic rather than such a trite piece of romantic nonsense. Cameron had the opportunity to make a definitive account of this well-known event and totally blew it.

","""Titanic"" is an overblown monstrosity which could have been great given tighter script, direction, and pacing. The film was easily an hour too long. That extra hour should have and could have been easily cut. As it is the film is a chore to get through and not a classic to revisit often; though the leads, Kate and Leonardo, have great performances, delivering a powerful romantic yarn, however these positives of ""Titanic"" are offset by the aforesaid over-indulgence in its own spectacle and grandiosity. This lack of self-restraint and efficient editing and storytelling really affect the second half of the film, making it almost unwatchable. Basically from the time the ship hits the iceberg the film suffers, it should have wrapped up with the catastrophe taking 20 minutes or so with a further 10 minute epilogue. But as it stands now at 3 and 1/4 hours it is obviously 60minutes too long. In summary, a famous film that probably appeals more to women, or young girls, than men, but it remains one of the great examples of a missed opportunity solely due to poor editing and pacing. My rating: 4/10. And the 100 year old lady should have been reciting the tale to her great-grandchild, not flying to a ship and telling a fortune hunter.
