10,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece."
10,The stage curtains open ...
,Very beautiful and cinematic movie with lots of classic scenes.Also extremely sad at times.Absolute 90's classic.
10,"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar)."
10,"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage."
10,"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again."
10,"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture."
10,"This is just a record breaker and you can see why. Even to this day I find anything Titanic related really interesting,. Such a great movie."
10,"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless."
10,"Flawless, enchanting, riveting, wondrous, totally out of this world. Astounding as this may sound, I've just now got around to watching ""Titanic,"" 23 years on, and I'm staggered at all that I've missed my whole life."
10,"To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it?  IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss.  The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think.  I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book.  It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.  I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that?  It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.  I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done."
9,"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short."
10,I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.
9,"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie."
10,"The low rating makes no sense to me at all... This movie is magnificent, so well made, the acting is superb. Anything below 9 doesn't do it any justice."
10,"You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! "
10,"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. "
10,This is one of the best movies in my opinion. The cast is amazing and I love them all! The story is very very sad but they did a really well job executing this movie to make it so amazing. The graphics and animation are amazing the music everyone knows it. It's comes to life when I think of the titanic of the movie. Even watching today I enjoy it just as much as I did the first time ever seeing this Leonardo and Kate were such a good pick for this movie and billy such good actors. I recommend watching this I mean I doubt there's many people that haven't seen this but. It is such a good movie!!
10,"I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece."
10,"This movie re-wrote film history in every way.  No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism.  Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it.  It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe.  One for the ages."
10,"Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well."
,Titanic is world famous. The film that broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many years(until it was overtaken by Jim Cameron's Avatar) is special because not only does it showcase the Titanic disaster in all its glory the film is a technical achievement of the highest order. The sinking sequence is astonishing and it feels like you are watching the actual ship sink. The characters and actors are amazing and even with a large running length you never dare look at the watch. James Cameron is a master director and Titanic is his stamp of authority.
10,"Though I have seen Titanic many times again, on TV and DVD, between 1997 and 2023, it took revisiting the film in a cinema for its 3D rerelease for this to strike home: James Cameron is a great director. Even after 25 years later, it merely expresses an awareness of the turnings of history on a big scale and how deeply they can cut us on the personal scale."
10,"From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom."
,"James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on."
9,"If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men."
,"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie.  Very impressive job."
7,"Since I was a teenager in 1997, I can say with some degree of confidence that Titanic was made for teenage girls. Almost all of my female friends of the time adored this movie and paid to see it multiple times in theaters, so I can see why it saw so much box office success. Also, there's no question that when the boat sinks, it's terrifyingly spectacular. However, the real downfall of this movie is the terribly corny dialogue. The script sounds like it was written by adolescents. Plus, the love story is overly melodramatic. I can see why Titanic made a splash, but I only really enjoy the last half."
,I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurances was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him.
10,People are crazy. They rate Avengers so high and they rate this masterpiece low? This is beyond absurd. You guys should encourage great filmmakers like this one not stupid ones like the super hero franchises. For the love of god.

,"It's really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say ""I'm king of the world"" when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once."
10,"My favorite film of all time. The best romance film ever made. The greatest love story ever told. When I was 12 years old, I watched Titanic for the first time and I felt so moved after this resonating cinematic experience. Everything about this film is timeless. From the mesmerizing lead performances, set design, costumes, cinematography, editing, music, and themes of love, loss, sacrifice, and social class politics of the early 20th century... this film will always have a special place in my heart. A notable mention is I consider Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet to be one of the best film couples of all time, and their undeniably beautiful, captivating, natural chemistry is unmatched."
9,"It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity, there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet."
,"While some viewers were disappointed that this wasn't just another A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, I believe that the use of the fictional characters was an effective story-telling device. "
10,"James Cameron's 'Titanic' is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence, a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event... It's an astonishing movie that exemplifies hope, love and humanity... "
10,"This is one of the greatest films of all time, and I will fight you on this fact. This is such a beautiful film, and has one of the greatest love stories I've ever seen brought to screen. It's an iconic film, so I don't know if I can bring anything new to the table. But still... I must say that these are some of the best characters ever. Rose is such a wonderful character, and I love the arc she experiences over the film. Jack is a charming love interest, and Cal is such a dynamic character, and is a fine villain. So many of the characters are played to perfection. The sinking in this film is one of the best technical feats in cinema, and I feel every emotion I can in this film. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the costumes are also glorious. The music is also wonderful, and the song 'My Heart Will Go On' is simply iconic! This is a film that is so cinematic and wonderful. Also, I got to see this on the big screen for the re-release, and it was absolutely amazing, and the way the film was meant to be experienced. It's one of the best cinematic experiences, and I love it."
8,"I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox."
8,"When you talk about 1990's pop culture, it's really hard to not mention, the biggest blockbuster from that decade, Oscar Winner, Best Picture of 1997's Titanic. Directed, written, by James Cameron, the movie had everything that people wish to see in a movie, making it one of the biggest money makers of all time. The movie had plenty of action, history, romantic, and music to get everybody onboard. The movie gives a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 14, 1912. It tells the story of two members of different social classes, high socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and working class, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio) falling in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The movie was so popular, that a 3D version of the film was released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earning it more money. The 3D version was pretty good. Titanic spun a number of other successful things such as; musicals, soundtrack, hundreds of different types of merchandise, books about the Titanic, a video game about Titanic and countless rip-offs movies. I think a good reason why a lot of people went to see this movie is how simple the story is. Yes, it's a bit predictable and pretty recycled from old Hollywood style that previous Titanic type movies had, such as 1958's A Night to Remember & 1953's Titanic. You can really see it, if you look close enough. It's full of familiar tropes and clichés. Still, the movie concept really got update to epic scale with the expensive budget, well use, in the films visual, special effects, costume, sets, and other sides of the production. James Cameron really made the movie felt like it overlap a lot of genres. It was great historical romantic action movie with many subplots like a treasure finding mystery suspense, a horror lifetime movie melodrama about female abuse, a social commentary film about classism and social Darwinism, etc. etc. Indeed, the movie is mostly label as a love movie, and this is where some people might be turn off. People do love story, when there is something in stake. By putting their lives in stake, people want to see them overcome the dangers. People also love movie if the two actors playing a couple really do show on chemistry on film. Both Leo & Kate did well in their roles showing their charm, but their characters don't have much depth to them. We really don't see, much faults in them. Their characters are very simplistic people. Also, some of their dialogue made the love story seem unrealistic or too silly to be taken serious of. Some people might hate the song by Celine Dion, 'Heart will go on' but in my opinion, the song works so well. I do think, it does get a little bit overplayed. I also have to give mad props to James Horner's score. All of the music in the film does give the movie, its great epic romantic tone and later, it's intense edge. I had lots of fun, watching the Titanic lower class party. The music there, really fit the scene. The movie also has great cinematography, as it was all eye candy to me. You can't help going in front of any ship bow, and not think of that scene from this movie. Indeed, you're feel like you're flying. For a PG-13 movie, I was deeply surprise how erotic, it was. I was just a little kid, when it first came out, the movie was the first time; I noticed that women had pubic hair. I found the sex scenes and the nudity to be tasteful. Still, the whole love affair, really does undermine, the time wasted that could cover the real victims of the Titanic sinking, more. While the actors playing supporting historical characters were all great in their roles. They were also all one-dimensional props. I still felt emotional to them, when 'Nearer, My God, to Thee,' to the tune of Bethany was playing. It was hard not to feel something about the film. Another thing people might hate is the pacing. The movie is really long and seem slow at times. The movie is also a bit historical inaccurate, but the movie went into great details to make the movie seem like the Titanic, you see here is the real Titanic. Buy the DVD as there are a lot of great special features like delete scenes, commentary, and behind the screens. The 2012 DVD version also clean up some of the big mistakes. It felt like the special edition that wasn't destroy the original work. If you happen to find it on TV, just note that it will be cut down, and censor a bit. It's nearly unwatchable. Overall: Sink or swim. Is the movie, the best Titanic movie ever? So-far, yes. Is it the worst? So-Far-no. It was safe exceptionalism type of movie. I wouldn't say, it's the smartest movie, but I would say, its lack of complexity doesn't make it not watchable. From the opening shot to the bittersweet ending, it was just amazing to watch. This movie like the actual event will always be remember on."
10,"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it."
9,"OK, so somehow I've managed to get to the age of 27 never having seen Titanic. Sure I know people love it, it won all the Oscars, it's constantly talked about, but I just kept thinking ""can it really be that good, surely it's over-hyped""... reader, it really is that good."
10,I just want to say wether fictional or not this movie is a masterpice and how it have only 7.8 rantings.
10,"I see little point in being the two thousandth six hundred and nineteenth person in reviewing this movie but why not? I saw this movie on its release, being a ten year old child I was more concerned about seeing a young naked female than watching fifteen thousand five hundred and three people die."
10,"This movie truly broke my heart. Jack and Rose face great difficulties (her being an aristocrat and him poor) but they still continue to fight fo their love no matter what. We first see an old lady which we later on know is Rose. She sees on the TV the drawing of her that Jack had made when thenews was talking about the Titanic shipwreck. She then goes on to call the news and tell her story.84 years ago on April 10th 1912, 17 year old Rose is on board on the Titanic ship along with her mom, grandma, and fiance, Caledon, (all of who'm were nobelty/aristocrats). Rose feels helpessly trapped by her situation ( marrying her snobby fiancé, Caledon) and tries to commit suicide by hanging off the edge of the deck until she was rescued by Jack. Jack is then invited by Caledon to a dinner amongst the rich in return for his heroic action. He goes through the evening acting his best at being rich. Jack then takes Rose down to the third-classe's party, where they dance endlessly. Shockingly, one of CaLedon's spies had followed them and informed him of his fiance's sneaking around. Rose was intruiged by Jack's drawings and so she asks him to draw her nude wearing the diamond necklace Caledon gave her. Caledon finds out and had plotted against Jack, he falsely accussed him of theft and had him locked away. Not long after, the ship encounters an iceberg which threatens to wreck it apart. Panic overflows the ship as the crew/staff takes safety precautions, giving people life vests. Soon, the lower parts of the ship begin to drown. Jack is in danger and so Rose is in panic to rescue him from the room in which he is in chains in. She manages to get an axe and breaks the chains. The water was almost head-level. They both swim upwards and get to the top of the ship. Boats were getting filled up, women and children going first. Caledon ushers Rose to go in, promising her that Jack was going to be safe. She doesn't believe him and returns back for Jack. Caledon, furious, chases after Jack and Rose with a gun in his hand. Fortunately all his shots miss and they manage to escape to the top of the ship. Caledon soon fakes having a child in order to board a boat. At this point, the Titanic's end was titing upwards at an extreme angles, people were falling off whilst others were lucky enough to clang onto stuff. Jack and Rose hold on to the top of the ship and get ready to dive into the deep, freezing water. Fortunately, Rose;s life vest allowed her to swim a bit more easily, can not say the same for Jck though. Rose clings onto a wooden boards whilst Jack is barely holds on to it. They pass out and by the time help comes, it was way too late... Jack had frozen to death. Unknowing of that fact, Rose tries to shake him awake until she comes into the shocking realization. Jack drops t the deep ocean, his corpse becoming a part of the ocean. She is then rescued by the crew and taken back. All the survivors from the Titanic are saved by the RMS Carpathia."
10,The best movie. Everyone watched it on February or on Valentine's Day. And I always love this movie so much. This is a Valentine's Day movie in case you need to know.
10,"This film is an absolute masterpiece, yet whenever it's discussed people often dismiss it or rarely praise it."
10,"Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here."
10,"I have loved this film since the day I saw it in 1999 on two VHS tapes on my post-soviet TV. I have watched it since then countless times, but never on a big screen until now. I, once again, fell in love with Titanic as I watched it in the theater."
10,"""Titanic"" is a masterpiece in every single angle: beautiful plot, amazing direction, stupendous visual effects, perfect cinematography, outstanding soundtrack, and breathtaking performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. This is a typical Hollywood movie but on a grand scale. ""Titanic"" will be known as the ""Gone with Wind"" of the 90s. James Cameron with his vision created a classic. He involves us from the beginning of the film, with real scenes of the wreckage of the Titanic in the present day. From there, he takes us back to the past and introduces each character in his opera. For more than three and half hours, we are embraced by the love story between Jack and Rose and also by the tragic event in every single details."
10,"When you have a film this big and successful, it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough, I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let's see..."
10,"The true reason that Jack has to die doesn't lie in the physics of surviving in very cold water, but in the inner logic of the story. Jack has to die because he exists in order to empower Rose and give her the will to live. And once that story purpose is fulfilled, he's gone."
10,"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!  I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. "
10,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are young lovers on the doomed ""Titanic"" in this 1997 film directed, written, and edited by James Cameron. The film also stars Billy Zane, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Francis Fisher, and Victor Garber."
8,"Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man. In ""Titanic"" he's more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked."
9,I've never watched Titanic until now. It caught my interest when I heard the story about those 5 people who lost their lives on an expedition to the Titanic.
10,"On a purely technical level, Titanic was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker who's always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next. Up until that point and still to this day, he's managed to do just that. He's always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jaw-dropping, mesmerizing visual spectacle. Even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew, due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off- the- boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for The Terminator, like it was the case in Aliens, he's always managed to deliver. It sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one, but everytime he does, he hits the box office's bullseye.
This time around and, with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen, he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90s.
From the very first shot of the movie, those sepia color-corrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss, to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship, we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the Titanic. And we go back to the plot. As I said before, using the simplest of plot devices, a , on the other hand, very well told love story with tinges of social clashing, we are treated to a 3 hour, eye - catching spectacle that moves along at a whip-like pace. With very strong performances all throughout, gorgeous cinematography and production design, state-of-the-art visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late James Horner, this is probably one of Cameron's best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages. Needless to say, the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act, with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem. That, as always, and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by Cameron, is the main reason to watch this movie, and why the audience is so invested in what's happening onscreen. As I said, great movie and larger-than-life characters to go with it."
10,It's 2019 and I still watch this movie sometimes and I am pretty sure that people are gonna keep watching this movie for the next 50 years and while watching this they will still feel that same emotion that they felt when they watched this movie for the first time. This movie still in the top 3 of the list of highest grossing movies of all time even after 22 years.
,Spoilers herein.
9,"Beautiful, feel-good and touching movie. All those poor souls that knew it was their end, I cannot imagine the horror. Leonardo DiCaprio is a generational talent; I cannot believe he was only around 20 years old when production began in 1995."
10,Titanic was such a wonderful movie!!! It accurately portrayed how the ship sunk to begin with. The storyline behind it all including the CAST!!! A+++ Film
10,There is no doubt that James Cameron is capable of putting out fantastic cinema. The man just seems to have a feel for what will pull on the emotions and his eye for scene setting has no equal. Some spoilers ahead.
10,Greetings from Lithuania.
10,7.9????
10,"I don't know why I have waited so long to see this but I finally got to see this in theaters during the 3D rerelease and oh how I messed up. This was the best 3D film I've seen as well as a top 5 movie of all time in my opinion. It has everything, romance, humor, terror, drama, and not too mention, one of the best ""historical"" movies out there. This also was the first time I cried during a movie, and I've seen too many to count. Someone may want to take my man card but I don't care. If this doesn't move you, you might need to get your pulse checked. Just an amazing movie. If you can see this in 3D, DO IT! It's worth the money and the slightly higher frame count is a really nice touch! It adds a little smoothness without the soap opera effect which can turn some people off. Cant wait for this to come out on 4K blu-ray! NEVER LET GO!!"
,Titanic (1997) 
10,"First time i saw this movie was when i was 8, with my mother in the theater."
9,"A big boat hits a huge lump of ice and slowly sinks. Meanwhile, a chirpy American lad, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets it on with Rose (Kate Winslet), a posh bit of British totty, much to the annoyance of the girl's fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane, putting in a wonderfully loathsome performance)."
10,"THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING!!! I love watching it! Jack and Rose, even though they are not real people and never were, feel so realistic and the effects and clothing and decoration they used in this movie makes it feel like I'm actually on the titanic with them! The flooding and sinking scenes were AMAZING and for a 1997 movie, I thought I was watching something from the future. This movie is a must-watch, and there is no wonder why it won so many awards, because it is most definitely the best movie this world has ever known. I also cannot think of anyone else to play Jack and Rose than Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They both did an absolutely awesome job and fit in very well with their roles, and the directors picked their entire cast very wisely. The ""My heart Will go on"" song was the perfect fit for the movie, and got stuck in my head after the 80th time I watched it, which is a very low estimate of the number of times I binge-watched this movie from my sofa with a bucket of popcorn. There are some bits of the movie which are not historically accurate, but oh so few of them, that it doesn't really even matter."
6,If only James Cameron could write dialogue!  
9,"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes."
10,Who says that old fashioned romantic films don't sell. They certainly do if they're done right as the story in Titanic certainly is.
10,"James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it. This poetic depiction is demonstrated with so much gusto and romance, that one cannot help but fall in love as the inevitable tragedy dismantles that colossal giant known as love present in all human beings."
10,"It's no wonder this was so seismically successful; it really has something for everyone: a sweet tragic love story, action and suspense and for history buffs a meticulous reenactment of the most infamous sea disaster of all time. Really a stunning achievement."
10,"It's the first movie I've watched in cinema. On the first seat. It was amazing.
It seemed like the ship was going inside me :)"
8,"Saw this on DVD with my family at a young age but only remember bits & pieces of it. Fast forward to 2012, & I saw this yet again, on the big screen for the 100th Anniversary of the actual ships sinking & found it to be great. I saw this again for the actual films 25th anniversary & found it even more great than before having not seen it in years."
10,"This story follows Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio). A poor artist who wins his ticket onboard the Titanic in a card game who meets Rose (Kate Winslet). A beautiful young woman who is raised in an uppercrust society who sees her life as too predictable and in control by her pompous buffoon fiamce Cal (Billy Zane) and craves a life of somewhat uncertainty. When Rose meets Jack an unlikely romance blossoms as the Titanic embarks on it's ill fated maiden voyage.
Cameron truly put in a lot of hard work to create an absolute masterpiece here. Yes the movie has flaws but what movie doesn't? I love how he made what could of been a dreary and gloomy drag of a movie and turned it into quite an up beat story (up until Titanic strikes the ice berg). This is in my favourites. And ignites a fascination for the tragic story that is the Titanic. So sad and outrageous how mostly third class passengers died in this disaster."
10,"It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status, but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet."
10,It really physically hurts me when i don't see it in top 250 in IMDb's list.I am from India where the general perception of Hollywood movies are that they are more action oriented big budget entertaining films.We consider our films to be more emotional and poignant.
10,"Hands down one of the best romance films ever made, Titanic is an epic, action-packed historical love story that delivers in every single way. Brilliant performance by Kate Winslet, beautiful and accurate costumes, feminist undertones, heart-wrenching, and golden to its core! Titanic is one of the greatest films ever made and that's all that has to be said."
10,I can´t find anythind that i don´t love from this film.
10,"Titanic is one of the best films both by James Cameron and in history in general for obvious reasons. It is a story of romance and tragedy that knew how to portray well the tragedy that occurred in Atlantic. It has many things going for it: an excellent script, very good production, excellent costume design, great cast with good performances, a beautiful soundtrack by James Hornet and Celine Dion, good direction, good special effects and the list can go on and on. This movie is certainly a true masterpiece of the seventh art that every movie lover can enjoy. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10."
10,"So I saw it as a child. And I didn't feel anything about it back then. Yes, a tragedy. Yes, a romantic story. But it all seemed to be pretty simple."
10,"So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies."
10,No spoilers! - Titanic
9,"There are two love stories in this film: the first Romeo and Juliet and the second James Cameron and the ship. Every millisecond is thought through, nothing is compromised and the attention to detail is extraordinary. The holes for each rivet in the hull of the 1/20th model were drilled by hand and actors who actually resembled the 1st Class passengers aboard ate and drank using teacups and cutlery stamped with the White Star Line emblem. The production is a seamless mix of miniatures, practical effects, CGI and actual footage from the wreck site and also genius in terms of saving money if you investigate further. There's nothing wrong with Leonardo DiCaprio's performance but Kate Winslet shines and, combined with the backstory of the search for the necklace, Titanic as a whole is an entertaining and respectful blend of fact and fiction, very well paced and doesn't feel like a 3 hour film. I'm a Titanic buff, so biased - the final few minutes of the ship tearing in two with hundreds of people still clinging to the stern makes me wince every time - but James Cameron's version of the disaster genuinely ticks every box. It's not only the most accurate account of the sinking ever committed to screen, but is still and will probably remain one of the best films ever made."
10,Well what can I say you gotta love a good disaster movie set on real events and Titanic checks ALL the boxes for a good movie. Set in April 1916 the movie opens with an elderly woman named Rose(played by the late Gracie Stuart)who talks to the reporters(one played by Bill Paxton from Mighty Joe Young) and she talks to them along with her granddaughter about the story of the Titanic. So we cut in to see all the people being sent aboard the famous ship and we see a younger looking Rose(played by Kate Winslet who looks so different with her dyed red hair)and her boorish fiancée played by Billy Zane(from The Phantom)who is by her side as she sets sail on the ship. 
9,"So you flip through the cable channels on your remote. The same old music videos are running, and the reruns get tiring. Later, you find something interesting. The evening news, Entertainment Tonight, 60 Minutes, VH1, and every other network airs clips from this, the biggest money-making film in history. TITANIC emerges as a genuine Hollywood classic for the second generation of American cinema. Never since GONE WITH THE WIND has there been powerful moviemaking with heavy genius from James Cameron. It's more than just a love story. It's an all-out disaster movie with style and vigor combined with a creative instrumental music score. It even began the craze that lured us into discoveries of the gigantic ship that never proved itself when it sunk anyway."
10,"Titanic ... what a movie! What a masterpiece! I've seen it dozens of times, and I'll never get tired of it. I always end in tears at the end. I find it underestimated by some, it is really a great cinema film. The achievement is magnificent, the casting is incredible. Thank you James Cameron ! This film is already 22 years old, and it ages very well. Timeless !"
10,It's a feeling!
10,This movie is extremely better then I expected it to be I thought it was just gonna be a stupid romantic movie with stupid characters but it's way more then that from how good James Cameron can make a female character and DiCaprio is also really good in this Jack and Rose have a really good chemistry then I was expecting and in the climax doesint hold back with a lot more shown deaths witch I wouldn't expect a lot of from James Cameron we also see when there going back to get survivors we see dead children a stuff and it's pretty disturbing I recommend this highly I had low expectations don't let the runtime scare you
9,"I am very lucky Person bcz I watched This Masterpiece ...I have No Words To describe This movie...
Story -Mindblowing
Direction - Awesome
Screenplay - The Heart of the film
Performances - World class"
10,"I wasn't really looking forward to this film, its a 3 hour romance movie and I am not a big fan of romance, but I gave this a chance and I have to say this is genuinely one of the best films I've ever seen. The movie manages to focus on a relationship between 2 different classes while also keeping it interesting with mystery, an intensity of what might happen, dread for the inevitable ending and also make many other characters interesting in there own right. The romance is done in a very realistic way and because of all the reasons I mentioned, the naturalistic acting of the actors and just how fun most of the characters are to watch on screen the movie really works. They also show the present and while I personally think that's the weakest part of the movie it does supply some interesting plot points and make the film more enjoyable overall as you're not constantly stuck in the past, the ending is also given a much more satisfying conclusion due to the present time scenes. Finally the 3rd act of the movie where the ship comes to its end is done in a brutal way showing just how much ruffles death it caused, how desperate the people where and how sad it was. The movie doesn't pull a punch and due to its long run time you almost feel like you know what it'd be like and almost like you yourself where there. Honestly I massively recommend giving this movie a change 10/10."
9,This film goes down in history as one of the best based on a true historical event. You'll feel the pain of the characters as the ship sinks. It's truly a human tragedy
8,"The increasing slight sense of foreboding, the humour at the climax that doesn't lighten up the tragedy but instead somehow makes it even more unsettling and ominous, the charming and extremely amiable star-crossed protagonists, to name a few. James Cameron's Titanic is one of the best indirect adaptations of Shakespeare's masterwork, Romeo and Juliet. Even when it comes to the issues I have with this film, most of them are pretty much similar to those I have with the play. And I've always found these issues justifiable to some extent. Also, the visuals are uniquely spectacular, and Céline Dion's My Heart Will Go On is timeless!"
10,"One of The best movies ive seen, 10/10 and People say its ok? This movie AT its best mfk."
10,MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE! THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE!
9,James Cameron's Titanic was something else. It's amazing to think how this movie came out in 1997. Titanic is a film that many will remember that broke ground. Not just for the actors involved but for filmmaking in general.
10,"In the opening sequence of Titanic, a group of treasure hunters send a robotic probe far beneath the ocean's surface in search of treasures (and one particularly precious jewel) still tucked aboard the titular sunken ship. The camera attached to the probe reveals a vessel that's certainly rotted but still carries hints of its prior glory. The explorers coo and sigh as they see what's been waiting a century for them, as if they're looking at their dreams made manifest. This is the day they've fantasized about, and the treasures of people who once lived and loved aboard the RMS Titanic are their bounty. When the film was released, it was a gamble the size of ... well, the metaphors present themselves a bit too easily. It was a wild risk, both for filmmaker James Cameron (who was known for Aliens and his Terminator movies) and for the studios that funded it, Paramount and 20th Century Fox. Cameron's terrible temper and a runaway production with troubles to spare - one disgruntled crew member laced the chowder at craft services with PCP one night, provoking hallucinations in 50 people, including cast member Bill Paxton - had prompted people to wonder if the legendarily expensive film was doomed for the same fate as its subject. The production budget reportedly ran over $200 million, an enormous sum by any contemporary standards that was much more so in 1997. Titanic remained No. 1 at the North American box office for 15 weeks in a row. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and won 11 of them, including Best Picture. The movie continued playing in theaters for nearly an entire year, and didn't close until October 1, 1998, after earning $600 million in North America and twice that worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until 2010, when Cameron's Avatar wrested away the title. Titanic is two movies stitched together: a swoony teenage fantasy for the ages, and a massive disaster movie that rivals any disaster movie to come out of Hollywood either before or since. The lengthy runtime makes perfect sense by this rubric, and you can see the seam where the movie pivots from one to the other, almost exactly at the halfway mark. That Titanic is two movies in one is part of its genius: If it were just the romance, it might have been written off as a ""movie for girls,"" but then there's this whole other disaster element too. From a marketing perspective, that's gold."
9,"This movie is very very good. The characters, the effects, the story. It's epic and very exciting. It gave us and interesting perspective about history events, and had an amazing music too. I liked how it sort of started as a romantic comedy, and than turned into more of an action movie. I wouldn't say this is the greatest movie of all times, but it is a Great movie."
3,"A tragic story. And not in the sense that it made me cry. This film is pathetic. The love story is tedious, the depiction of Irish peasantry panders to the crassest stereotypes and Celine Dion's stinky theme song is just the icing an a horrible anti-cake. Somewhere along the line, around about Terminator 2 and True Lies, director James Cameron went badly astray. He became so obsessed with setting new Special Effects standards that he lost sight of characters, dramatic plausibility and any measure of emotional honesty, which are all far more essential to a film's credibility. The characters in this film are bland and uninspiring. To call them one-dimensional would be an insult to Geometry."
10,"One of the saddest and most tragic stories, frightening when it comes to the disaster in a certain way. One of the most important films in Cinema history so definitely a must watch and 10/10."
10,"It's a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. Period.
I pity those who haven't watched it yet or didn't like it."
9,"James Cameron and his team really did their research. I can see it happening just like this, love story notwithstanding. Historical fiction absolutely done right. Some of the CGI is subpar but it's a minor flaw considering the rest of the picture."
1,"Everything about this movie it's garbage . Inane ,dull or boring are too gentle words to describe how bad is this movie ."
8,"I haven't seen this in a very long time. I have always been a fan. Looking back on it now it's not as good as it was then, but still very good. There are a million little dumb things that bother me but they're not real complaints. And maybe this is from seeing the movie so many times. I can tell you exactly where the first VHS cut off."
3,First; let me say that the recreation of the RMS Titanic as a computer- generated entity is extremely well realised. If ever we needed proof that CGI can add an extra dimension to established technique and 'effects' when it's done with meticulous precision - here it is.
4,"This movie right here is ""Overrating"" in its prime."
5,"No sense going into great detail about this film, which just about everyone who watches movies saw when it came out. I still don't recall a film getting as much ""hype"" as this one did. I doubt if the Second Coming would get the kind of publicity this movie received. It was disgusting - the PR, the story and the favorable box office response."
10,"I'm rewatching this now. It has held up very well after all these years. I saw this in the theaters when I was 22. It was just me and my boyfriend who I recently just started seeing. We are no longer together, but I still remember him saying that the way the two were holding each others hands at the bow of the boat, reminded him of the way we touched each other's hands at the time. We were in love, just as Rose and Jack were. This movie also touched home because I too came from money and thought most of the rich people I knew and had dated were uptight and didn't seem to let loose enough and have fun....and I was afraid too I would fall in a trap to it and live a boring existence. It gave me more strength to branch out and not search for someone to love just because of their wealth and status in the world, but instead find love for whats inside a person. My world is better now because of that decision. So I thank you Titanic!"
3,"I detested this movie so much when I first saw it that I really wanted to give it one star, but as bad as I still think it is, it is fairly well-made and at least the technical department earned their salaries here (though quite frankly I thought that some of the CGI effects screamed ""FAKE!"" louder than the scale models used by Roy Ward Baker in 1958's A NIGHT TO REMEMBER). What sinks this movie for me (pun very much intended) is the fictional love story forcibly inserted by Cameron, doubtless with the cynical intention of attracting teenage girls. Which it did. By the millions."
10,"I Think Every Person In The World Must Have Watched ""Titanic"" Atleast Once... I Have Watched It Atleast 70-80 Times On TV/OTT, But Today I Watched It In A Theater For The First Time At The Occasion Of It's 25th Anniversary & Couldn't Stop Myself From Writing A Review... Well, This Epic Doesn't Needs One, But This Is Just To Tell People That How Much I Enjoyed Watching This Exqusite Piece Of Cinema On The Big Screen... All The Great Movie Experiences Will Fail In Front Of It & You'll Come Out With A Smile On Your Face... I Also Think This Is James Cameron's Most Mature Work Till Date & Stands Much Above Terminator & Avatar... Please Don't Miss The Golden Opportunity Of Watching This Absolute Gem Of A Film In Cinemas."
9,"James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic is timeless, moving, and a real visual splendor (though they could brush up on one or two CGI scenes). The attention to detail is stunning and breathtaking. It is perfectly written and perfectly cast - particularly with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They both are extremely talented, top-notch actors.
You don't even notice how long it goes for. It grabs you and sucks you in. But it is also sad and a bit depressing knowing what will happen at the end. I haven't cried at a movie in a long time, so was surprised to find myself crying at this movie. I can relate in some respects to Rose and I really like the message about enjoying life.
A strongly recommended movie."
9,"Well, it's been a year since my last review of this film (this is review #3).  I saw ""Titanic"" on the big screen in 1997, and bought the DVD when it came out (which I still watch from time to time, maybe about twice/year)."
8,Titanic (1997)
3,"The movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the States. The movie made it big globally, had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of Academy Awards. The question, however, is – was this movie really that good? In my opinion, Titanic, while not intrinsically bad, is an overrated cinematic venture. For a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter, not exemplary . There was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie. Mr. Cameron, the director of the movie, is known for his sci-fi ventures, while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment. Strangely, the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel, which diverted attention from the focal event- the shipwreck. The director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted. Cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy, and requires a careful treatment of subject matter. Though undoubtedly a visual stunner, replete with amazing special effects, something the director excels in, the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization. Titanic suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received."
10,"It's bitterly ironic that the biggest blockbuster of all time is not on the IMDb's Top 250. Even stranger still, many who loved it at the time of its release have now turned on it (just ask anyone under the age of 25). This is not due to its quality, but to its hype. It goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release, but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing. People began to tire of hearing about what the stars (especially the new heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio) were doing, and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about ""Titanic."" The film had the odds against it: it's a romance, and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity. By the time the spoofs of the film's most famous scenes came along, ""Titanic's"" reputation was already in danger. After that, people began only to see the spoofs, and now the film's popularity has sunk to where the real ship is."
8,"You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding!"
10,"One of the monuments of the cinema which won 11 Oscars in Hollywood in 1998, a huge success (well deserved) all over the world. The revelation of two actors until then virtually unknown. This is James Cameron' masterpiece. He chose to relate the tragedy of the Titanic that took place on the 12th of April 1912, through the intermediary of a love story lived between a wealthy and pretty young woman (Kate Winslet) and a modest painter (Léonardo Dicaprio). Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie. The love between ""Jack"" and ""Rose"" is so strong that can hardly believe the Titanic will bump into an iceberg and will sink. It's also together with a model bravery that the two lovers will try to escape the ship's sinking (although historically accurate)."
,"I am not as much offended by this movie because of its historical inaccuracy. It is true that for all the hype about how the china, carpeting and furniture reproduced exactly those of the Titanic, and how the ship sunk exactly in the way described by the movie, and so on, the plot is entirely fictitious and proud of it. In itself that is not bad, what's bad is how cheesy and cliché this plot is, and that this cheesy, cliché and invented story occupies 90% of the movie's attention, with the sinking of the ship treated as something on the side. The only important people are the main couple, Jack and Rose, her fiancé and her mother. The remaining characters are treated with a disinterest that borders on disrespect. We only get to know that the third-class passengers are fun-loving and warm, and those in first-class are stuffy, snobbish and exceedingly preoccupied with dinner cutlery. Wow, isn't that new! The whole thing is so fake, it was really difficult to get minimally interested."

10,"James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments. He is an exceptional story teller and fully deserved all the accolades he has acquired. "
10,This film is the best motion picture in my opinion.
5,"Well, it's not ""Avatar"" levels of disappointment, but ""Titanic"" is far from Cameron's best work. Don't get me wrong, there's a great disaster epic here, but you've gotta work for it. The actual iceberg doesn't appear until 100 minutes in. A hundred. That's a lot of forced love story to slog through before real dread starts to build. And the less said about that song, the better."
10,"Every single scene in this movie is perfect. The characters are so heartfelt, and seeing their reactions as most of them face certain death is heartbreaking. The sets are so, so beautiful. Rose and Jack are a heart throbbing couple, making the ending even more heartbreaking. The soundtrack may very well be the best score for a movie I've ever seen. The world feels so alive, so breathtaking, and to see it all slowly crumble and disappear is beautiful. This film is breathtaking, with the entire last half constantly leaving you on the edge of your seat. The ending is heartbreaking, and for many will leave you crying."
10,"In honor of the 100 year anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, the movie Titanic was re-released in theaters, digitally remastered and in 3-D. Having seen the movie in theaters in 1998 when it came out, and loving it ever since, I was happy to go see it again in 2012. We owned the VHS when I was growing up so I've probably seen Titanic at least a dozen times. There's nothing quite like seeing it in theaters though. It's a film of epic proportions in both budget and content, and I think seeing it on the big screen does it incredible justice. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it there for the second time."
