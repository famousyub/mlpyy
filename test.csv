","Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films.

21 November 2001,jhclues,10," The Magic Comes To Life!
","Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2017,stormhawk2021,8," Epic film
","Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv

","I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Great fun!
","I really liked this film, but I much prefer the book, which has a lot more magic and wonder. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv

","Over-hyped but still enjoyable ""event"" movie, one of the biggest of 2001 until LORD OF THE RINGS comes out, and a film in which every million of the budget is put up on screen in the special effects. What I found most refreshing about this blockbuster is that the entire cast is made up of British actors and actresses! It makes a change for an expensive blockbuster movie to be thus but there you go, HARRY POTTER is indeed a unique movie. Now I'm not one of those people with lots of time on their hands to read the never-ending Harry Potter books (too busy watching cult movies I'm afraid), but the film has turned out pretty much as I would have expected from the adverts. Although it's overly sentimental (blame it on director Chris Columbus) and aimed at children, adults can still enjoy it for the excellent pacing (rarely does the two-and-a-half hour running time drag) and the plethora of special - and some not so special - effects on view throughout.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2014,ironhorse_iv,7," This movie set in stone, what would be the foundation of the Harry Potter film franchise. It kinda work.
","It's seem like just yesterday, when the movie about the boy whom lived, was about to come out. People were wondering if the Harry Potter's books by J.K Rowling could easily be translated into the big screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone AKA Sorcerer's Stone directed by Chris Columbus, indeed show that it was somewhat possible. The story follows Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)'s first year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry as he discovers his gift and destiny against the dark forces of magic. The movie like the other films are cut into two plots directions. One is about student life at Hogwarts during the school-year, while the other half is about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. It works well as a long read novel, but in movie form: its means a long sit through. The movie pacing is so long. It takes forever to get to the main plot of Harry Potter finding the Philosopher Stone. There are is a lot of filler scenes that could be cut away. I dislike how the Philosopher Stone is one-time movie McGuffin. For the best of my knowledge, the Philosopher stone plays no factor after this movie, and never mention again after this film. The third act, mostly comes out of nowhere. The twist toward the end, was pretty predictable, if you readt the books, but pretty interesting. Another thing about the movie is how non-logical the movie is. It really baffled me, how much exposition, it needed. Even an hour in the film, there were a lot of random odd things happening without much explaining. It gets more confusing as long bits of the book, like the Centaur showing in the woods, were shorten in the film. It gets worst for the centaur, as he wouldn't play a factor, in any of the later films, despite, saving Harry Potter from Voldermort. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also cut short. Her riddle solving in the book was cut from the film. Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, as well. Despite those, the movie is really close to the novel. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. Still, there were some really dumb things to nitpick here like why would Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even allow Harry Potter to stay with the Dursley's family when he knows that they're horrible people. Honestly, the Dursleys could had killed Harry Potter with the childhood neglect! What was he thinking? Harry Potter could had commit suicide, or gone crazy like Lord Voldermort! What an idiot! The whole movie is about children being danger all the time. I don't care if they're wizards in training, I'm surprise that the death tolls of students dying isn't as high as it should be. The school staff is questionable at times. A good example of this stupidity, is punishing students whom went out at nights, by sending them out at nights in the dark forest, where they can get attacked by creatures. The most insulting thing in logic is the black/white one-dimensional view of good Vs evil. Honestly, how on earth is the members of Slytherin never got expulsion for all the bullies that it has? You would think, that at less, there would be one good person in Slytherin. Another thing that bugs me is the whole the power of love conquer all. I think, children are a lot smarter than the childish message, the film is trying to pull. The acting in the movie is pretty bland, for the most part. After all, most of the child actors had this film as their first roles. I wouldn't say that Harry Potter's film series, have the most entertaining of dialogues, anyways. The wooden delivery, felt like a read-through. Most of what they're saying are stating the obvious or repeating what happening on screen. It's so annoying. The other actors were master British thespians, who seem to over-act at times. A good example of this is John Hurt & Alan Rickman. It was too hammy for already over the top world. The action scenes were pretty well-done. My favorite had to be the Quidditch match and the whole chess game. I can do, without the whole troll scene. The CGI troll hasn't aged well. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. I love the special effects, locations & set, and costume, they did. It really made the Harry Potter world, stand out. The music by John Williams is amazing to listen to. I think director Chris Columbus was indeed the best choice for this first movie, as he got the magically part, right and how to make a family picture. You even see, how much things, he establish that other directors would reused time after time. Still, I really hope for Terry Gilliam like J.K Rowling's first choice to be the direction. The movie has great social commentary themes like the metaphor of racism, ethnic cleansing and why Nazism is bad. You can also see possible influences from other words, that made Harry Potter work. There was a few controversial moments leading up to the film, like religious debates. A few religious groups claim that Harry Potter contain occult or Satanic subtexts that isn't good for children. Another one is the use of the word, sorcerer over the word philosopher in the title. US & British have different meanings to the words, plus marketing though, it would better to call it sorcerer as that word get more appeal. Due to this different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name had to be reshot, once with the actors saying ""philosopher's"" and once with ""sorcerer's"". Overall: The movie might has its flaws, but majority, a great first watch for any fantasy fan.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv

I also want to mention that even my family members like to watch it with me. My grandmother especially likes it. This fact indicates that this movie is interesting not only for children but also for elderly people and it's not weird for me. There are so many things going on in this movie, so many secrets and beautiful scenes. Plus a big thanks for the graphics of the movie, everything is very realistic. For example, the mermaids or the dinosaurs. Moreover, there is a massive animatronic creature in this movie- spider and after watching the movie google about it and found out that Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron Weasley, one of the main characters, is afraid of spiders just s much as his character is, and said it was easily the scariest scenes to film. I'm scared of spiders too, and I know how it feels when you see them. Thus, I really appreciate the job that this actor did. In my opinion, despite the fact that he had to play again a guy, who was scaring from spiders, it is again hard to play the role by looking at the creature that gives you goosebumps.

It's a delight to watch, I've seen this movie numerous times and it never fails to make me smile, to cheer me up when I'm feeling down, the Harry Potter franchise is magical both inside and out, and it's simple fun to watch Harry go in to his first year at Hogwarts, the story's quite simple as the series kicks off with a light start, but it will still leave you wanting more. The films biggest flaw is, at times, it is too faithful to the book that it is based off, I'm sure this is pleasing for anyone who's read the book, but for those who haven't it tends to drag out at times, more than an hour passes before Potter even goes to Hogwarts and the main adventure dosen't unfold properly until at least one hundred minutes in, it can get a little tedious at times and that's why I'm giving it an eight instead of a nine that it easily could have received. The cast is outstanding, the young cast members are ridiculously talented for their age, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have no trouble playing a lead role, and both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson shine as his closest friends, they never lose a single bit of likability. They are joined by a terrific adult cast, including the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and, the highlight of the movie for me, Richard Harris, he shines as Professor Dumbledore (sadly only for two movies), his characterization is perfect, he is wise, heartwarming and simply a lovable character.

","All the Harry Potter films in this series are pretty good. Some are better than others, but over-all, the seven together is quite a motion picture experience. This one is the first one in the series and is the best one to get started with. This first film is so well produced, that it should satisfy you enough to watch even more of them. This film also works on its own. That is good, in case, you never get a chance to see another one again in your life. Start with the first one I always say. Being the first film also means, I have seen it the most. I saw this film as soon as it landed on DVD, then when I realized there would be a seven or eight film run on the Harry Potter series, i stopped watching them and waited for all of them to be released in a DVD package, which I finally finished in 2017. This film still works great today as it did 20 years ago.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have seen this movie numerous times on TV, but I was never able to watch it in it's entirety some reason until today where I managed to watch it all and it did not disappoint. The story is just really intriguing right from the start where you introduced to the character Harry Potter who is just very likeable which makes you root for him against his so called family. The world of Hogwarts is amazing and makes you want to wish it was a real place. The story is easy to follow and it's not predictable which I liked as there are a few twists which just make the movie even more thrilling. I have seen bits of the other movies on TV as well and I hope they are as good if not better as this.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" or sometimes also ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is the first film from one of the most successful movie franchises in cinema history. The books were written by Joanne K. Rowling and adapted by Steve Kloves (not a name to many), who also directed ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" earlier in his career. It is about a small boy with hidden powers, who is not particularly liked by his uncle, aunt and cousin. They took care of him after his parents died when he was a baby. So he gets picked up by an unusually looking, rather gruff magician and taken to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is not a normal school. While the bonding with fellow students, the fraternities and sports activities are there as well, everything is just a little bit more magical and different.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv

","It was amazing to watch how a huge movie franchise started with this one. It showed a basis for the entire Harry Potter timeline. The visual effects were very great for this film. It was on-point and did not feel amateurish. Unfortunately for me, everything else was a bit stale and unexciting. I was in doubt of whether it really maximized its runtime. There were, in some parts, too many scenes which the characters were doing a lot of dialogues. The production design and costumes were excellent aspects of the film, too. But for me a lot of dark cinematography was utilized, instead of a more lively kind of production.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2008,g-bodyl,10," A Magical Movie Moment!
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is what a book adaptation should be. The only things left out of the movie were very minor. This tells the story of a boy whose parents were killed when he was young and been mistreated by his aunt and uncle. He receives a letter about a school named Hogwarts. There, in his first year with his friends Ron and Hermione, he must stop wrongdoing of a couple teachers. The cast was wonderfully casted. Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic and looks the part of Harry. Everyone else is perfect. As I mentioned above, the adaptation is great. The movie even used the same quotations as the books. The music is memorable. I liked John William's Hedwig Theme. The costumes are good-looking and so is everything else. This movie will leave a magical imprint on your minds and this is only the first film. I rate this magical adventure 10/10.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not being a reader of the Harry Potter books, I came to the first Harry Potter movie with a totally open mind. There seems to be those who love the book but hate the film; those that love both; and even a few who hate both! Having watched Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, I must confess that I'm not entirely sure what all the fuss is about. This strikes me as solid but unremarkable, totally overlong but fairly diverting fare.",/review/rw2103350/?ref_=tt_urv
